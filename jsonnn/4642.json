{"Quote": "It's not all bad. Heightened self-consciousness, apartness, an inability to join in, physical shame and self-loathingâ€”they are not all bad. Those devils have been my angels. Without them I would never have disappeared into language, literature, the mind, laughter and all the mad intensities that made and unmade me.", "Author": "Stephen Fry,  Moab Is My Washpot", "Category": "philosophy"}
