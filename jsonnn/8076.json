{"Quote": "Words do not express thoughts very well; every thing immediately becomes a little different, a little distorted, a little foolish. And yet it also pleases me and seems right that what is of value and wisdom of one man seems nonsense to another.", "Author": "Gautama Buddha", "Category": "philosophy"}
