{"Quote": "If you only had 48 hours left to live, would you spend it like you normally spend your weekends? If not, why spend 2/7th of your life wasting your free time? After all, free time isnâ€™t free. Free time is the most expensive time you have, because nobody pays for it but you. But that also makes it the most valuable time you have, as you alone stand to reap the profits from spending it wisely.", "Author": "Jarod Kintz,  I Should Have Renamed This", "Category": "philosophy"}
