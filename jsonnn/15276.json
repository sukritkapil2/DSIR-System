{"Quote": "Reading is sometimes thought of as a form of escapism, and itâ€™s a common turn of phrase to speak of getting lost in a book. But a book can also be where one finds oneself; and when a reader is grasped and held by a book, reading does not feel like an escape from life so much as it feels like an urgent, crucial dimension of life itself.", "Author": "Rebecca Mead,  My Life in Middlemarch", "Category": "books"}
