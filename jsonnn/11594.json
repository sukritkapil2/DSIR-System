{"Quote": "A thought is harmless unless we believe it. It’s not our thoughts, but our attachment to our thoughts, that causes suffering. Attaching to a thought means believing that it’s true, without inquiring. A belief is a thought that we’ve been attaching to, often for years.", "Author": "Byron Katie,  Loving What Is: Four Questions That Can Change Your Life", "Category": "truth"}
