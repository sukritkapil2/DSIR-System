{"Quote": "I do not miss childhood, but I miss the way I took pleasure in small things, even as greater things crumbled. I could not control the world I was in, could not walk away from things or people or moments that hurt, but I took joy in the things that made me happy.", "Author": "Neil Gaiman,  The Ocean at the End of the Lane", "Category": "happiness"}
