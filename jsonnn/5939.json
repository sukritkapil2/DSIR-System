{"Quote": "Teach the ignorant as much as you can; society is culpable in not providing a free education for all and it must answer for the night which it produces. If the soul is left in darkness sins will be committed. The guilty one is not he who commits the sin, but he who causes the darkness.", "Author": "Victor Hugo,  Les Mis√©rables", "Category": "education"}
