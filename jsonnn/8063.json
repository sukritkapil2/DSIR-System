{"Quote": "Reading changes your life. Reading unlocks worlds unknown or forgotten, taking travelers around the world and through time. Reading helps you escape the confines of school and pursue your own education. Through characters – the saints and the sinners, real or imagined – reading shows you how to be a better human being.", "Author": "Donalyn Miller,  The Book Whisperer: Awakening the Inner Reader in Every Child", "Category": "books"}
