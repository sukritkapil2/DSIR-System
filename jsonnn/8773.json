{"Quote": "We are born to love as we are born to die, and between the heartbeats of those two great mysteries lies all the tangled undergrowth of our tiny lives. There is nowhere to go but through. And so we walk on, lost, and lost again, in the mapless wilderness of love.", "Author": "Tim Farrington,  The Monk Downstairs", "Category": "love"}
