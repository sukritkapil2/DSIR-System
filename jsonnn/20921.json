{"Quote": "One of chief pieces of advice I give to aspiring rationalists is \"Don't try to be clever.\"And, \"Listen to those quiet, nagging doubts.\"If you don't know, you don't know what you don't know, you don't know how much you don't know, and you don't know how much you needed to know.", "Author": "Eliezer Yudkowsky", "Category": "philosophy"}
