{"Quote": "Eric called Al's suicide brave, and he was wrong. My mother's death was brave. I remember how calm she was, how determined. It isn't just brave that she died for me; it is brave that she did it without announcing it, without hesitation, and without appearing to consider another option.", "Author": "Veronica Roth,  Divergent", "Category": "love"}
