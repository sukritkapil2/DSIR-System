{"Quote": "We must never stop dreaming. Dreams provide nourishment for the soul, just as a meal does for the body. Many times in our lives we see our dreams shattered and our desires frustrated, but we have to continue dreaming. If we don't, our soul dies, and agape cannot reach it.", "Author": "Paulo Coelho,  The Pilgrimage", "Category": "soul"}
