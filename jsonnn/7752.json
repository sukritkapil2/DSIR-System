{"Quote": "If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning.", "Author": "C.S. Lewis,  Mere Christianity", "Category": "life"}
