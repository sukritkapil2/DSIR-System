{"Quote": "I believe in the city as a natural human environment, but we must humanize it. It's art that will re-define public space in the 21st Century. We can make our cities diverse, inspirational places by putting art, dance and performance in all its forms into the matrix of street life.", "Author": "Antony Gormley", "Category": "inspiration"}
