{"Quote": "Do you know what I think about crying? I think some people have to learn to do it. But once you learn, once you know how to really cry, there's nothing quite like it. I feel sorry for those who don't know the trick. It's like whistling or singing.", "Author": "Anne Rice,  Memnoch the Devil", "Category": "writing"}
