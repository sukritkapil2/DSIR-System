{"Quote": "Writing, painting, singing- it cannot stop everything. Cannot halt death in its tracks. But perhaps it can make the pause between deathâ€™s footsteps sound and look and feel beautiful, can make the space of waiting a place where you can linger without as much fear. For we are all walking each other to our deaths, and the journey there between footsteps makes up our lives.", "Author": "Ally Condie,  Reached", "Category": "writing"}
