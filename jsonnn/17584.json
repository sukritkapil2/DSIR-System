{"Quote": "The nature of the enemy's warfare in your life is to cause you to become discouraged and to cast away your confidence. Not that you would necessarily discard your salvation, but you could give up your hope of God's deliverance. The enemy wants to numb you into a coping kind of Christianity that has given up hope of seeing God's resurrection power.", "Author": "Bob Sorge,  Glory: When Heaven Invades Earth", "Category": "hope"}
