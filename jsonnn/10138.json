{"Quote": "I believe this. When we meet those we fall in love with, there is an aspect of our spirit that is historian, a bit of a pedant who reminisces or remembers a meeting when the other has passed by innocentlyâ€¦but all parts of the body must be ready for the other, all atoms must jump in one direction for desire to occur.", "Author": "Michael Ondaatje,  The English Patient", "Category": "love"}
