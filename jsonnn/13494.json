{"Quote": "Who is the third who walks always beside you?When I count, there are only you and I togetherBut when I look ahead up the white roadThere is always another one walking beside youGliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hoodedI do not know whether a man or a woman-But who is that on the other side of you?", "Author": "T.S. Eliot,  The Waste Land and Other Poems", "Category": "poetry"}
