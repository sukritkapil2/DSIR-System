{"Quote": "If a man, who says he loves you, wonâ€™t tell you the details of a private conversation between him and another woman you can be sure he is not protecting your heart. He is protecting himself and the women he has feelings for. Wise women simply see things as they are, not as their low self-esteem allows.", "Author": "Shannon L. Alder", "Category": "relationship"}
