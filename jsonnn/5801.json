{"Quote": "Home wasn't a set house, or a single town on a map. It was wherever the people who loved you were, whenever you were together. Not a place, but a moment, and then another, building on each other like bricks to create a solid shelter that you take with you for your entire life, wherever you may go.", "Author": "Sarah Dessen,  What Happened to Goodbye", "Category": "life"}
