{"Quote": "She is all the great heroines of the world in one. She is more than an individual. I love her, and I must make her love me. I want to make Romeo jealous. I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter, and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain.", "Author": "Oscar Wilde,  The Picture of Dorian Gray", "Category": "romance"}
