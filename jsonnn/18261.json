{"Quote": "Anyone who thinks cryptozoology is the study of the impossible has never really taken a very good look at the so-called \"natural world.\"Once you get past the megamouth sharks, naked mole rats, and spotted hyenas, then the basilisks, dragons, and cuckoos just don't seem that unreasonable. Unpleasant, yes, but unreasonable? Not really.", "Author": "Seanan McGuire,  Discount Armageddon", "Category": "science"}
