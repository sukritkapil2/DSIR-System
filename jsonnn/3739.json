{"Quote": "The bond forged between us was not one that could be broken by absence, distance, or time. And no matter how much more special or beautiful or brilliant or perfect than me he might be, he was as irreversibly altered as I was. As I would always belong to him, so would he always be mine.", "Author": "Stephenie Meyer,  New Moon", "Category": "love"}
