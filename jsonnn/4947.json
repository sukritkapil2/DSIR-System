{"Quote": "The world was a terrible place, cruel, pitiless, dark as a bad dream. Not a good place to live. Only in books could you find pity, comfort, happiness - and love. Books loved anyone who opened them, they gave you security and friendship and didn't ask anything in return; they never went away, never, not even when you treated them badly.", "Author": "Cornelia Funke,  The Inkheart Trilogy: Inkheart, Inkspell, Inkdeath", "Category": "books"}
