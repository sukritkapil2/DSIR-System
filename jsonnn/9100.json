{"Quote": "There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,There is a rapture on the lonely shore,There is society, where none intrudes,By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:I love not Man the less, but Nature more,From these our interviews, in which I stealFrom all I may be, or have been before,To mingle with the Universe, and feelWhat I can neâ€™er express, yet cannot all conceal.", "Author": "George Gordon Byron,  Childe Harold's Pilgrimage", "Category": "poetry"}
