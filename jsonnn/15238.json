{"Quote": "Start telling the truth now and never stop. Begin by telling the truth to yourself about yourself. Then tell the truth to yourself about someone else. Then tell the truth about yourself to another. Then tell the truth about another to that other. Finally, tell the truth to everyone about everything. These are the 5 levels of truth telling. This is the five-fold path to freedom.", "Author": "Neale Donald Walsch,  Conversations With God: An Uncommon Dialogue, Vol. 2", "Category": "god"}
