{"Quote": "But there are roughly two sorts of informed people, aren't there? People who start off right by observing the pitfalls and mistakes and going round them, and the people who fall into them and get out and know they're there because of that. They both come to the same conclusions but they don't have quite the same point of view.", "Author": "Margery Allingham,  Dancers in Mourning", "Category": "knowledge"}
