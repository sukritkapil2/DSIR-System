{"Quote": "Sometimes I go to God and say, \"God, if Thou dost never answer another prayer while I live on this earth, I will still worship Thee as long as I live and in the ages to come for what Thou hast done already. God’s already put me so far in debt that if I were to live one million millenniums I couldn’t pay Him for what He’s done for me.", "Author": "A.W. Tozer", "Category": "life"}
