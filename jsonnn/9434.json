{"Quote": "There are five people you meet in heaven. Each of us was in your life for a reason. You may not have known the reason at the time, and that is what heaven is for. For understanding your life on earth. This is the greatest gift God can give you: to understand what happened in your life. To have it explained. It is the peace you have been searching for.", "Author": "Mitch Albom,  The Five People You Meet in Heaven", "Category": "life"}
