{"Quote": "Disappointments in love, even betrayals and losses, serve the soul at the very moment they seem in life to be tragedies. The soul is partly in time and partly in eternity. We might remember the part that resides in eternity when we feel despair over the part that is in life.", "Author": "Thomas Moore,  Care of the Soul: Guide for Cultivating Depth and Sacredness in Everyday Life", "Category": "love"}
