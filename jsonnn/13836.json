{"Quote": "If you and I are to live religious lives, it mustn't be that we talk a lot about religion, but that our manner of life is different. It is my belief that only if you try to be helpful to other people will you in the end find your way to God.", "Author": "Ludwig Wittgenstein", "Category": "religion"}
