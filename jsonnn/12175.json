{"Quote": "Tell me not in mournful numbers,Life is but an empty dream!For the soul is dead that slumbers,And things are not what they seem.Life is real! Life is earnest!And the grave is not its goal;Dust thou are, to dust thou returnest,Was not spoken of the soul.", "Author": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow,  Voices of the Night", "Category": "life"}
