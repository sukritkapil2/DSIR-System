{"Quote": "Old men tend to forget what thought was like in their youth; they forget the quickness of the mental jump, the daring of the youthful intuition, the agility of the fresh insight. They become accustomed to the more plodding varieties of reason, and because this is more than made up by the accumulation of experience, old men think themselves wiser than the young.", "Author": "Isaac Asimov,  Pebble in the Sky", "Category": "wisdom"}
