{"Quote": "Death! Strange that there should be such a word, and such a thing, and we ever forget it; that one should be living, warm and beautiful, full of hopes, desires and wants, one day, and the next be gone, utterly gone, and forever!", "Author": "Harriet Beecher Stowe,  Uncle Tom's Cabin", "Category": "death"}
