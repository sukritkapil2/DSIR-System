{"Quote": "Guilt reminds me of a stray cat. You chase it away and yet, it comes back when you least expect it. If you let yourself feel pity for it and feed the thing, it parks its ugly, puny, lonely-for-attention butt on your doormat and won't go away. Scat kitty cat, scat. I don't need you sitting around here like that.", "Author": "Lisa Schroeder,  I Heart You, You Haunt Me", "Category": "life"}
