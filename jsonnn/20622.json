{"Quote": "I'm not particularly in favor of doctrine or creed, ordination, the elevation of holy texts, the institution of church, or, for that matter, Christianity. Like most religions, it has irreconcilable shortcomings and an unforgivable history. What I do favor is the attempt to make sense of things by living within a story. The Christian story, for good or ill, is my inheritance.", "Author": "Elizabeth Jarrett Andrew,  On The Threshold: Home, Hardwood, and Holiness", "Category": "inspiration"}
