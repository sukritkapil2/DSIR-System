{"Quote": "Parting is inevitably painful, even for a short time. It's like an amputation, I feel a limb is being torn off, without which I shall be unable to function. And yet, once it is done... life rushes back into the void, richer, more vivid and fuller than before.", "Author": "Anne Morrow Lindbergh", "Category": "death"}
