{"Quote": "The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pedants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist; a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain.", "Author": "Ursula K. Le Guin,  The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas", "Category": "happiness"}
