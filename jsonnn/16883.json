{"Quote": "I wonder that religion can live or die on the strength of a faint, stirring breeze. The scent trail shifts, causing the predator to miss the pounce. One god draws in the breath of life and rises; another god expires.", "Author": "Barbara Kingsolver,  The Poisonwood Bible", "Category": "religion"}
