{"Quote": "Work is a blessing. God has so arranged the world that work is necessary, and He gives us hands and strength to do it. The enjoyment of leisure would be nothing if we had only leisure. It is the joy of work well done that enables us to enjoy rest, just as it is the experiences of hunger and thirst that make food and drink such pleasures.", "Author": "Elisabeth Elliot,  Discipline: The Glad Surrender", "Category": "inspiration"}
