{"Quote": "In-existence, the soulâ€™s greatest imposition is its perfection. It is projected as a perfected form of the physical embodiment, an emblem of things, perhaps hyperreal and untouchably perfect as existence. It can not be! The soul in-existence is nothing of perfection. It is raw potential. The soul is nothing but potential. To be specific, the soul is unordered potential!", "Author": "Dew Platt,  The Rudeness of Soul", "Category": "soul"}
