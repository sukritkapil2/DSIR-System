{"Quote": "You made me confess the fears that I have. But I will tell you also what I do not fear. I do not fear to be alone or to be spurned for another or to leave whatever I have to leave. And I am not afraid to make a mistake, even a great mistake, a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too.", "Author": "James Joyce,  A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man", "Category": "religion"}
