{"Quote": "The only obsession everyone wants: 'love.' People think that in falling in love they make themselves whole? The Platonic union of souls? I think otherwise. I think you're whole before you begin. And the love fractures you. You're whole, and then you're cracked open.", "Author": "Philip Roth,  The Dying Animal", "Category": "love"}
