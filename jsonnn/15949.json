{"Quote": "Living a life fully engaged and full of whimsy and the kind of things that love does is something most people plan to do, but along the way they just kind of forget. Their dreams become one of those \"we'll go there next time\"deferrals. The sad thing is, for many there is no \"next time\"because passing on the chance to cross over is an overall attitude toward life rather than a single decision.", "Author": "Bob Goff,  Love Does: Discover a Secretly Incredible Life in an Ordinary World", "Category": "inspiration"}
