{"Quote": "Although time seems to fly, it never travels faster than one day at a time. Each day is a new opportunity to live your life to the fullest. In each waking day, you will find scores of blessings and opportunities for positive change. Do not let your TODAY be stolen by the unchangeable past or the indefinite future! Today is a new day!", "Author": "Steve Maraboli,  Life, the Truth, and Being Free", "Category": "success"}
