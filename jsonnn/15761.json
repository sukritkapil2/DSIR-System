{"Quote": "Surrender your own poverty and acknowledge your nothingness to the Lord. Whether you understand it or not, God loves you, is present in you, lives in you, dwells in you, calls you, saves you and offers you an understanding and compassion which are like nothing you have ever found in a book or heard in a sermon.", "Author": "Thomas Merton,  The Hidden Ground Of Love: The Letters Of Thomas Merton On Religious Experience And Social Concerns", "Category": "god"}
