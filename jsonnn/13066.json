{"Quote": "To be commanded to love God at all, let alone in the wilderness, is like being commanded to be well when we are sick, to sing for joy when we are dying of thirst, to run when our legs are broken. But this is the first and great commandment nonetheless. Even in the wilderness - especially in the wilderness - you shall love him.", "Author": "Frederick Buechner,  A Room Called Remember: Uncollected Pieces", "Category": "god"}
