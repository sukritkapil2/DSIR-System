{"Quote": "In El-har√≠m, there lived a man, a man with yellow eyes.To me, he said, \"Beware the whispers, for they whisper lies.Do not wrestle with the demons of the dark,Else upon your mind they'll place a mark;Do not listen to the shadows of the deep,Else they haunt you even when you sleep.", "Author": "Christopher Paolini,  Inheritance", "Category": "mind"}
