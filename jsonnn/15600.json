{"Quote": "People who do not love themselves can adore others, because adoration is making someone else big and ourselves small. They can desire others, because desire comes out of sense of inner incompleteness, which demands to be filled. But they can not love others, because love is an affirmation of the living growing being in all of us. If you donâ€™t have it, you cant give it.", "Author": "Andrew Matthews", "Category": "inspiration"}
