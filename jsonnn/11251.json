{"Quote": "Women intrinsically understand human dynamics, and that makes them unstoppable. Unfortunately, the average man is less adroit at fostering such rivalries, which is why most men remain average; males are better at hating things that can't hate them back (e.g., lawnmowers, cats, the Denver Broncos, et cetera). They don't see the big picture.", "Author": "Chuck Klosterman,  Chuck Klosterman IV: A Decade of Curious People and Dangerous Ideas", "Category": "humor"}
