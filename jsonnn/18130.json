{"Quote": "Education is not confined to books, and the finest characters often graduate from no college, but make experience their master, and life their book. [Some care] only for the mental culture, and [are] in danger of over-studying, under the delusion . . . that learning must be had at all costs, forgetting that health and real wisdom are better.", "Author": "Louisa May Alcott,  Jo's Boys", "Category": "education"}
