{"Quote": "Happiness in this world, when it comes, comes incidentally. Make it the object of pursuit, and it leads us a wild-goose chase, and is never attained. Follow some other object, and very possibly we may find that we have caught happiness without dreaming of it.", "Author": "Nathaniel Hawthorne", "Category": "happiness"}
