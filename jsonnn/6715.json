{"Quote": "Time weighs down on you like an old, ambiguous dream. You keep on moving, trying to sleep through it. But even if you go to the ends of the earth, you won't be able to escape it. Still, you have to go there- to the edge of the world. There's something you can't do unless you get there.", "Author": "Haruki Murakami,  Kafka on the Shore", "Category": "inspiration"}
