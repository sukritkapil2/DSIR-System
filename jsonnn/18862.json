{"Quote": "The question is why one should be so inwardly preoccupied at all. Why not reach out to others in love and solidarity or peer into the natural world for some glimmer of understanding? Why retreat into anxious introspection when, as Emerson might have said, there is a vast world outside to explore? Why spend so much time working on oneself when there is so much real work to be done?", "Author": "Barbara Ehrenreich,  Bright-Sided: How the Relentless Promotion of Positive Thinking Has Undermined America", "Category": "positive"}
