{"Quote": "That's what I love about reading: one tiny thing will interest you in a book, and that tiny thing will lead you to another book, and another bit there will lead you onto a third book. It's geometrically progressive - all with no end in sight, and for no other reason than sheer enjoyment.", "Author": "Mary Ann Shaffer,  The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society", "Category": "books"}
