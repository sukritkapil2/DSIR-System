{"Quote": "Geography is the key, the crucial accident of birth. A piece of protein could be a snail, a sea lion, or a systems analyst, but it had to start somewhere.

And the landscape in which the protein \"starts\"shapes its end as surely as bowls shape water.", "Author": "Annie Dillard,  Teaching a Stone to Talk: Expeditions and Encounters", "Category": "science"}
