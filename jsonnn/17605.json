{"Quote": "I sat, a solitary man,In a crowded London shop,An open book and empty cupOn the marble table-top.While on the shop and street I gazedMy body of a sudden blazed;And twenty minutes more or lessIt seemed, so great my happiness,That I was blessed and could bless.", "Author": "W.B. Yeats,  The Winding Stair and Other Poems", "Category": "poetry"}
