{"Quote": "There is no compulsion for man to accept the truth. But it is certainly a shame upon the human intellect when man is not even interested in finding out as to what is the truth!

To reflect and to question and to reflect.", "Author": "Maurice Bucaille,  The Qur'an and Modern Science", "Category": "truth"}
