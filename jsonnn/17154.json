{"Quote": "Now I'm making a decision. I choose life. I shall live because there are few people I want to stay with for the longest possible time and because I have duties to discharge. It is not my concern whether or not life has meaning. If I am unable to forgive, then I shall try to forget. I shall live by force and cunning.\"Â­", "Author": "tayeb saleh,  Season of Migration to the North", "Category": "hope"}
