{"Quote": "God is love,\"she said. \"And he respects love, whether it's between a parents, and child, a man and woman, or friends. I don't think he cares about religion one little bit. Live your life right. Love with all your heart. Don't hurt others, and help those in need. That is all you need to know. And don't worry about heaven. If it exists, you'll be welcome.", "Author": "Ellen Hopkins,  Burned", "Category": "god"}
