{"Quote": "Turning and turning in the widening gyreThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhereThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;The best lack all conviction, while the worstAre full of passionate intensity.", "Author": "W.B. Yeats,  The Collected Poems of W.B. Yeats", "Category": "poetry"}
