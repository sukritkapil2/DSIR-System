{"Quote": "Our belief is not a belief. Our principles are not a faith. We do not rely soley upon science and reason, because these are necessary rather than sufficient factors, but we distrust anything that contradicts science or outrages reason. We may differ on many things, but what we respect is free inquiry, openmindedness, and the pursuit of ideas for their own sake.", "Author": "Christopher Hitchens,  God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything", "Category": "god"}
