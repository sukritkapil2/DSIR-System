{"Quote": "If we are to love our neighbors, before doing anything else we must see our neighbors. With our imagination as well as our eyes, that is to say like artists, we must see not just their faces but the life behind and within their faces. Here it is love that is the frame we see them in.", "Author": "Frederick Buechner,  Whistling in the Dark: A Doubter's Dictionary", "Category": "love"}
