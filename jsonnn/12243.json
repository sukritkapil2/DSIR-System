{"Quote": "The magic of purpose and of love in its purest form. Not televison love, with its glare and hollow and sequined glint; not sex and allure, all high shoes and high drama, everything both too small and in too much excess, but just love. Love like rain, like the smell of a tangerine, like a surprise found in your pocket.", "Author": "Deb Caletti,  Honey, Baby, Sweetheart", "Category": "purpose"}
