{"Quote": "When asked if I am pessimistic or optimistic about the future, my answer is always the same: if you look at the science about what is happening on earth and aren't pessimistic, you don't understand the data. But if you meet the people who are working to restore this earth and the lives of the poor, and you aren't optimistic, you haven't got a pulse.", "Author": "Martin Keogh,  Hope Beneath Our Feet: Restoring Our Place in the Natural World", "Category": "hope"}
