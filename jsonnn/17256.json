{"Quote": "Doubt not, O poet, but persist. Say 'It is in me, and shall out.' Stand there, balked and dumb, stuttering and stammering, hissed and hooted, stand and strive, until at last rage draw out of thee that dream-power which every night shows thee is thine own; a power transcending all limit and privacy, and by virtue of which a man is the conductor of the whole river of electricity.", "Author": "Ralph Waldo Emerson,  The Essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson", "Category": "inspiration"}
