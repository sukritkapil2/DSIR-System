That's not morality, that's just sucking up, apple-polishing, looking over your shoulder at the great surveillance camera in the sky, or the still small wiretap inside your head, monitoring your every move, even your every base though.", "Author": "Richard Dawkins,  The God Delusion", "Category": "god"}
