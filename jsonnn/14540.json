{"Quote": "The sunset produces flower clouds in a garden in the sky, and while there is still light you can see a heavenly representation of my love for you.The sunrise produces rays that light up the world like your eyes do when you're with me. They shimmer and I can see the stars in your eyes that gleam from your soul.-Jarod Kintz and Karen Quan", "Author": "Jarod Kintz,  liQUID PROse QUOtes", "Category": "relationship"}
