{"Quote": "We made love outdoorsâ€”without a roof, I like most, without stove, my favorite place, assuming the weather be fair and balmy, and the earth beneath be clean. Our souls intertwined and dripping with dew, and our love for each other was seen. Our love for the world was new.", "Author": "Roman Payne", "Category": "soul"}
