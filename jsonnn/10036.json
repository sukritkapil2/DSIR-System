{"Quote": "As long as you have life and breath, believe. Believe for those who cannot. Believe even if you have stopped believing. Believe for the sake of the dead, for love, to keep your heart beating, believe. Never give up, never despair, let no mystery confound you into the conclusion that mystery cannot be yours.", "Author": "Mark Helprin,  A Soldier of the Great War", "Category": "inspiration"}
