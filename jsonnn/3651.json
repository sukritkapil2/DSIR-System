{"Quote": "The power of a glance has been so much abused in love stories, that it has come to be disbelieved in. Few people dare now to say that two beings have fallen in love because they have looked at each other. Yet it is in this way that love begins, and in this way only.", "Author": "Victor Hugo,  Les Mis√©rables", "Category": "love"}
