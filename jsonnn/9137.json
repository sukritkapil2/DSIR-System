{"Quote": "The fact that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. The happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality of happiness, and by no means a necessity of life.", "Author": "George Bernard Shaw,  Androcles and the Lion", "Category": "religion"}
