{"Quote": "So once I thought of the villain with a sense of humor, I began to think of a name and the name &quot;the Joker&quot; immediately came to mind. There was the association with the Joker in the deck of cards, and I probably yelled literally, 'Eureka!' because I knew I had the name and the image at the same time.", "Author": "Jerry Robinson", "Category": "humor"}
