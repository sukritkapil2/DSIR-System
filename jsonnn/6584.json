{"Quote": "If you send out goodness from yourself, or if you share that which is happy or good within you, it will all come back to you multiplied ten thousand times. In the kingdom of love there is no competition; there is no possessiveness or control. The more love you give away, the more love you will have.", "Author": "John O'Donohue,  Anam Cara: A Book of Celtic Wisdom", "Category": "love"}
