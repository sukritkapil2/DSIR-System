{"Quote": "My life closed twice before its close; It yet remains to seeIf Immortality unveil A third event to me,So huge, so hopeless to conceive, As these that twice befell.Parting is all we know of heaven, And all we need of hell.", "Author": "Emily Dickinson,  Dickinson: Poems", "Category": "death"}
