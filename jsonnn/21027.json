{"Quote": "We can remove the veil that shrouds our understanding and made us forget who we truly are. When we understand the core self and live from the core self, the myth of separation, concepts of separation, color, religion, class, intelligenceâ€¦all these fade away. We are not our color. We are not our religion. We are not our sexual preference. We are human beings. We are spiritual beings.", "Author": "Cassandra Blizzard,  A World Without Color", "Category": "inspiration"}
