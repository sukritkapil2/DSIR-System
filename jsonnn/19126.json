{"Quote": "He in whom the love of repose predominates will accept the first creed, the first philosophy, the first political party he meets â€” most likely his father's. He gets rest, commodity, and reputation; but he shuts the door of truth.", "Author": "Ralph Waldo Emerson", "Category": "philosophy"}
