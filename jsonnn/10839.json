{"Quote": "The best birthday present I ever got from my grandpa was a skinny black tie. It didn’t come in a bag, a box, or even rolled up in tissue paper. It came wrapped in wisdom. As soon as he gave it to me he said, “A tie would make a stronger impression on your boss if you used it as a blindfold and kidnapped him. That‘s why I bought you a black one.", "Author": "Jarod Kintz,  American Association for the Advancement of Aardvarks Presents: Dear Natalie", "Category": "wisdom"}
