{"Quote": "The story of my recent life.' I like that phrase. It makes more sense than 'the story of my life', because we get so many lives between birth and death. A life to be a child. A life to come of age. A life to wander, to settle, to fall in love, to parent, to test our promise, to realize our mortality- and in some lucky cases, to do something after that realization.", "Author": "Mitch Albom,  Have a Little Faith: a True Story", "Category": "inspiration"}
