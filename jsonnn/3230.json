{"Quote": "Dreams are always crushing when they don't come true. But it's the simple dreams that are often the most painful because they seem so personal, so reasonable, so attainable. You're always close enough to touch, but never quite close enough to hold and it's enough to break your heart.", "Author": "Nicholas Sparks,  Three Weeks With My Brother", "Category": ""}
