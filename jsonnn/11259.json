{"Quote": "According to most philosophers, God in making the world enslaved it. According to Christianity, in making it, He set it free. God had written, not so much a poem, but rather a play; a play he had planned as perfect, but which had necessarily been left to human actors and stage-managers, who had since made a great mess of it.", "Author": "G.K. Chesterton,  Orthodoxy", "Category": "religion"}
