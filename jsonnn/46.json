{"desc": "Spring Dynamic Modules in Action introduces Spring DM and OSGi to Java EE developers and architects. It presents the fundamental concepts of OSGi-based apps and maps them to the familiar ideas of the Spring framework. Then, it engages you with the techniques and concepts you'll need to develop stable, flexible enterprise apps. You'll learn how to embed a Spring container inside an OSGi bundle, and how Spring DM lets you blend Spring strengths like dependency injection with OSGi-based services. Along the way, you'll see how Spring DM handles data access and web-based components, and you'll explore topics like unit testing and configuration in an OSGi-based environment.", "title": "Spring Dynamic Modules in Action", "thumbnailUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/cogoluegnes.jpg", "authors": ["Arnaud Cogoluegnes", "Thierry Templier", "Andy Piper"], "categories": ["Java"]}
