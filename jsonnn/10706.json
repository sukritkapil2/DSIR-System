{"Quote": "We're all fools,\"said Clemens, \"all the time. It's just we're a different kind each day. We think, I'm not a fool today. I've learned my lesson. I was a fool yesterday but not this morning. Then tomorrow we find out that, yes, we were a fool today too. I think the only way we can grow and get on in this world is to accept the fact we're not perfect and live accordingly.", "Author": "Ray Bradbury,  The Illustrated Man", "Category": "wisdom"}
