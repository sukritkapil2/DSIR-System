{"Quote": "Weather is a purely personal matter. There is no such thing as a climate that is cold or hot, good or bad, healthy or unhealthy. People take it upon themselves to create a fantasy in their imagination and call it weather. There's only one climate in the world, but the message that nature sends is interpreted according to strictly personal, non-transferable rules.", "Author": "√Ålvaro Mutis,  The Adventures and Misadventures of Maqroll", "Category": "philosophy"}
