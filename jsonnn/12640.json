{"Quote": "Not much music left inside us for life to dance to. Our youth has gone to the ends of the earth to die in the silence of the truth. And where, I ask you, can a man escape to, when he hasn't enough madness left inside him? The truth is an endless death agony. The truth is death. You have to choose: death or lies. I've never been able to kill myself.", "Author": "Louis-Ferdinand CÃ©line,  Journey to the End of the Night", "Category": "death"}
