{"Quote": "After his experience with Minos, Nico realized that most spectres held only as much power as you allowed them to have. They pried into your mind, using fear or anger or longing to influence you. Nico had learned to shield himself. Sometimes he could even turn the tables and bend ghosts to his will.", "Author": "Rick Riordan,  The Blood of Olympus", "Category": "wisdom"}
