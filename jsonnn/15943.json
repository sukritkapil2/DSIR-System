{"Quote": "I often say that I don't worry about the meaning of life--I can't handle that big stuff. What concerns me is the meaning in life--day by day, hour by hour, while I'm doing whatever it is that I do. What counts is not what I do, but how I think about myself while I'm doing it.", "Author": "Robert Fulghum,  It Was on Fire When I Lay Down on It", "Category": "life"}
