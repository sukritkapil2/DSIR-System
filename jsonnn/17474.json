{"Quote": "The thing about living alone is that it gives you a lot of time to think. You don't necessarily reach any conclusions, because wisdom is largely a function of intelligence and self-awareness, not time on your hands. But you do become very good at thinking yourself into endless loops of desperation in half the time it would take a normal person.", "Author": "Jonathan Tropper,  One Last Thing Before I Go", "Category": "wisdom"}
