{"Quote": "When we look for success, it should be for the sole purpose of boasting sincerely in Christ. There's no other reason for it. Success is only worth it when the more intense it gets for you, the more you find yourself bragging for his glory rather than your own.", "Author": "Criss Jami,  Killosophy", "Category": "faith"}
