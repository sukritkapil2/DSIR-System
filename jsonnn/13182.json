{"Quote": "I am not yours, not lost in you,Not lost, although I long to beLost as a candle lit at noon,Lost as a snowflake in the sea.You love me, and I find you stillA spirit beautiful and bright,Yet I am I, who long to beLost as a light is lost in light.", "Author": "Sara Teasdale,  Love Songs", "Category": "poetry"}
