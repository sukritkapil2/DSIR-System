{"Quote": "I saw Eternity the other night,Like a great ring of pure and endless light,All calm, as it was bright,And round beneath it, Time, in hours, days, years,Driven by the spheres,Like a vast shadow moved, in which the worldAnd all her train were hurled.", "Author": "Madeleine L'Engle,  A Ring of Endless Light", "Category": "inspiration"}
