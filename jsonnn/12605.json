{"Quote": "I don't regret my painful times, i bare my scars as if they were medals. I know that freedom has a high price, as high as that of slavery; the only difference is that you pay with pleasure and a smile, even when that that smile dimmed by tears", "Author": "Paulo Coelho", "Category": "inspiration"}
