{"Quote": "You forget everything. The hours slip by. You travel in your chair through centuries you seem seem to see before you, your thoughts are caught up in the story, dallying with the details or following the course of the plot, you enter into characters, so that it seems as if it were your own heart beating beneath their costumes.", "Author": "Gustave Flaubert,  Madame Bovary", "Category": "books"}
