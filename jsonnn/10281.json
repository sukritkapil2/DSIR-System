{"Quote": "Some people try to tell you the things you want in life are out of your grasp, while others lift you up on their shoulders and help you reach them. I may not know a lot, but I prefer to fill my life with people who let me climb on top of their shoulders, not people who try to keep me planted on the ground.", "Author": "Katie Kacvinsky,  Awaken", "Category": "inspiration"}
