{"Quote": "Those things for which the most money is demanded are never the things which the student most wants. Tuition, for instance, is an important item in the term bill, while for the far more valuable education which he gets by associating with the most cultivated of his contemporaries no charge is made.", "Author": "Henry David Thoreau,  Walden", "Category": "education"}
