{"Quote": "Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself... You may house their bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.", "Author": "Kahlil Gibran", "Category": "inspiration"}
