{"Quote": "As we live and as we are, Simplicity - with a capital \"S\"- is difficult to comprehend nowadays. We are no longer truly simple. We no longer live in simple terms or places. Life is a more complex struggle now. It is now valiant to be simple: a courageous thing to even want to be simple. It is a spiritual thing to comprehend what simplicity means.", "Author": "Frank Lloyd Wright,  The Natural House", "Category": "life"}
