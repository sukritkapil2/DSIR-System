{"Quote": "There shall always be a day and a night until the world meets its ebb and we shall always hope to sleep and wake up to see another day! Such is called life! So many people have life, but, few people are living. We shall continue to exist from dawn to dusk having life and living or just having life!", "Author": "Ernest Agyemang Yeboah", "Category": "inspiration"}
