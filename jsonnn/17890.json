{"Quote": "A fish cannot drown in water,A bird does not fall in air.In the fire of creation,God doesn't vanish:The fire brightens.Each creature God mademust live in its own true nature;How could I resist my nature,That lives for oneness with God?", "Author": "Mechthild of Magdeburg,  Meditations from Mechthild of Magdeburg", "Category": "god"}
