{"Quote": "Oxford in the Inklings' day was not so different in look and smell from the Oxford of today. Then, as now, one was tempted to fantasize one's surroundings as a Camelot of intellectual knight-errantry or an Eden of serene contemplation. Then, as now, there was bound to be disappointment.", "Author": "Philip Zaleski,  The Fellowship: The Literary Lives of the Inklings: J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S.
