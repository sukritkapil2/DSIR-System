{"Quote": "If there is no love in the world, we will make a new world, and we will give it walls, and we will furnish it with soft, red interiors, from the inside out, and give it a knocker that resonates like a diamond falling to a jeweller's felt so that we should never hear it. Love me, because love doesn't exist, and I have tried everything that does.", "Author": "Jonathan Safran Foer,  Everything Is Illuminated", "Category": "love"}
