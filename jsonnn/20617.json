{"Quote": "When his writing is going well, Gordon Strangle Mars likes to wake up at 6 a.m. and go out driving. He works out new plot lines about giant spiders and keeps an eye out for abandoned couches, which he wrestles into the back of his pickup truck. Then he writes for the rest of the day.", "Author": "Kelly Link,  Pretty Monsters: Stories", "Category": "inspiration"}
