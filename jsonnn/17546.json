{"Quote": "This was how it was with travel: one city gives you gifts, another robs you. One gives you the heartâ€™s affections, the other destroys your soul. Cities and countries are as alive and feeling, as fickle and uncertain as people. Their degrees of love and devotion are as varying as with any human relation. Just as one is good, another is bad.", "Author": "Roman Payne,  Cities & Countries", "Category": "soul"}
