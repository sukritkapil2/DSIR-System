{"Quote": "Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's sizeBut when I start to tell them,They think I'm telling lies.I say,It's in the reach of my armsThe span of my hips,The stride of my step,The curl of my lips.I'm a womanPhenomenally.Phenomenal woman,That's me.", "Author": "Maya Angelou,  Phenomenal Woman: Four Poems Celebrating Women", "Category": ""}
