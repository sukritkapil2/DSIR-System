{"desc": "R in Action is the first book to present both the R system and the use cases that make it such a compelling package for business developers. The book begins by introducing the R language, including the development environment. As you work through various examples illustrating R's features, you'll also get a crash course in practical statistics, including basic and advanced models for normal and non-normal data, longitudinal and survival data, and a wide variety of multivariate methods. Both data mining methodologies and approaches to messy and incomplete data are included.", "title": "R in Action", "thumbnailUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/kabacoff.jpg", "authors": ["Robert I.
