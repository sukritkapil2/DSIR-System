{"Quote": "I like the scientific spirit—the holding off, the being sure but not too sure, the willingness to surrender ideas when the evidence is against them: this is ultimately fine—it always keeps the way beyond open—always gives life, thought, affection, the whole man, a chance to try over again after a mistake—after a wrong guess.", "Author": "Walt Whitman,  Walt Whitman's Camden Conversations", "Category": "science"}
