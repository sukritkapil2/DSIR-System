{"Quote": "Usually we walk around constantly believing ourselves. \"I'm okay\"we say. \"I'm alright\". But sometimes the truth arrives on you and you can't get it off. That's when you realize that sometimes it isn't even an answer--it's a question. Even now, I wonder how much of my life is convinced.", "Author": "Markus Zusak,  The Book Thief", "Category": "truth"}
