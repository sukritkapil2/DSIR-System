{"Quote": "Hush Hattie!\"I said, intoxicated with my success. \"I don't want to go to my room. Everyone must know I shan't marry the prince.\"I ran to the door to our street, opened it, and called out into the night, \"I shan't marry the prince.\"I turned back into the hall and ran to Char and threw my arms about his neck. \"I shan't marry you.\"I kissed his cheek. He was safe from me.", "Author": "Gail Carson Levine,  Ella Enchanted", "Category": "humor"}
