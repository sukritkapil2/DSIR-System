{"Quote": "Isnâ€™t it time that these most ancient sorrows of ours grew fruitful? Time that we tenderly loosed ourselves from the loved one, and, unsteadily, survived: the way the arrow, suddenly all vector, survives the string to be more than itself. For abiding is nowhere.", "Author": "Rainer Maria Rilke,  Duino Elegies", "Category": "poetry"}
