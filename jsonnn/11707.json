{"Quote": "When I step out on stage in front of thousands of people, I don't feel that I'm being brave. It can take much more courage to express true feelings to one person. [...] In spite of the risks, the courage to be honest and intimate opens the way to self-discovery. It offers what we all want, the promise of love.", "Author": "Michael Jackson,  Dancing the Dream", "Category": "love"}
