{"Quote": "Turn around and believe that the good news that we are loved is better than we ever dared hope, and that to believe in that good news, to live out of it and toward it, to be in love with that good news, is of all glad things in this world the gladdest thing of all. Amen, and come Lord Jesus.", "Author": "Frederick Buechner,  The Clown in the Belfry: Writings on Faith and Fiction", "Category": "inspiration"}
