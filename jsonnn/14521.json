{"Quote": "Very often in everyday life one sees that by losing one's temper with someone who has already lost his, one does not gain anything but only sets out upon the path of stupidity. He who has enough self-control to stand firm at the moment when the other person is in a temper, wins in the end. It is not he who has spoken a hundred words aloud who has won; it is he who has perhaps spoken only one word.", "Author": "Hazrat Inayat Khan,  Mastery through Accomplishment", "Category": "inspiration"}
