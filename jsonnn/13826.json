{"Quote": "Come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.", "Author": "Anonymous,  Holy Bible: King James Version", "Category": "faith"}
