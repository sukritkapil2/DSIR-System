{"Quote": "A lot of people experience the world with the same incredulity as when a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat.â€¦We know that the world is not all sleight of hand and deception because we are in it, we are part of it. Actually we are the white rabbit being pulled out of the hat. The only difference beween us and the white rabbit is that the rabbit does not realize it is taking part in a magic trick.", "Author": "Jostein Gaarder,  Sophie's World", "Category": "philosophy"}
