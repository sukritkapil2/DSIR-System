{"Quote": "People die all the time. Life is a lot more fragile than we think. So you should treat others in a way that leaves no regrets. Fairly, and if possible, sincerely. It's too easy not to make the effort, then weep and wring your hands after the person dies.", "Author": "Haruki Murakami,  Dance Dance Dance", "Category": "death"}
