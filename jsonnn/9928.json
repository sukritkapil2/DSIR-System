{"Quote": "Freedom is a heavy load, a great and strange burden for the spirit to undertake. It is not easy. It is not a gift given, but a choice made, and the choice may be a hard one. The road goes upward towards the light; but the laden traveler may never reach the end of it.", "Author": "Ursula K. Le Guin,  The Tombs of Atuan", "Category": "inspiration"}
