{"Quote": "It might be a good idea if, like the White Queen, we practiced believing six impossible things every morning before breakfast, for we are called on to believe what to many people is impossible. Instead of rejoicing in this glorious \"impossible\"which gives meaning and dignity to our lives, we try to domesticate God, to make his might actions comprehensible to our finite minds.", "Author": "Madeleine L'Engle", "Category": "god"}
