{"Quote": "Why covet a knowledge of new facts? Day and night, house and garden, a few books, a few actions, serve us as well as would all trades and all spectacles. We are far from having exhausted the significance of the few symbols we use. We can come to use them yet with a terrible simplicity.", "Author": "Ralph Waldo Emerson,  The Essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson", "Category": "knowledge"}
