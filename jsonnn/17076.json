{"Quote": "Out of the cacophony of random suffering and chaos that can mark human life, the life artist sees or creates a symphony of meaning and order. A life of wholeness does not depend on what we experience. Wholeness depends on how we experience our lives.", "Author": "Desmond Tutu", "Category": "faith"}
