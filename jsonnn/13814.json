{"Quote": "In imagination she sailed over storied seas that wash the distant shining shores of \"faÃ«ry lands forlorn,\"where lost Atlantis and Elysium lie, with the evening star for pilot, to the land of Heart's Desire. And she was richer in those dreams than in realities; for things seen pass away, but the things that are unseen are eternal.", "Author": "L.M.
