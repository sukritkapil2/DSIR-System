{"Quote": "For Ragamuffins, God's name is Mercy. We see our darkness as a prized possession because it drives us into the heart of God. Without mercy our darkness would plunge us into despair - for some, self-destruction. Time alone with God reveals the unfathomable depths of the poverty of the spirit. We are so poor that even our poverty is not our own: It belongs to the mysterium tremendum of a loving God.", "Author": "Brennan Manning,  The Ragamuffin Gospel: Good News for the Bedraggled, Beat-Up, and Burnt Out", "Category": "god"}
