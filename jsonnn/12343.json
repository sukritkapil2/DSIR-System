{"Quote": "The pen will never be able to move fast enough to write down every word discovered in the space of memory. Some things have been lost forever, other things will perhaps be remembered again, and still other things have been lost and found and lost again. There is no way to be sure of any this.", "Author": "Paul Auster,  The Invention of Solitude", "Category": "writing"}
