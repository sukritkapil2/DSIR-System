{"Quote": "Every problem has a gift for you in its hands‚Äù (Richard Bach). And if not every problem, then just about every one. Even spectacular sunsets are not possible without cloudy skies. Troubles bring a gift for those who choose to look. And since I can't avoid my problems, why waste them? I should look for the gift. My life will be far, far richer for finding it.", "Author": "Steve Goodier", "Category": "hope"}
