{"Quote": "There were times when I lifted my face to the sky, stretched my arms wide to the winter night, and laughed out loud, so happy was I.The memory of it makes me laugh now, but not from happiness.Be careful what you show the world.You never know when the wolf is watching.", "Author": "Jennifer Donnelly,  Revolution", "Category": "happiness"}
