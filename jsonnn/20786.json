{"Quote": "We've all received our share of good fortune, so that's my definition of much. A single blessing is all the bounty in the world, and if you've been blessed at all you're meant to pass some of that on. You're meant to set a positive example. That's our responsibility\"(20) - Denzel Washington, \"So that We Might Follow", "Author": "Denzel Washington,  A Hand to Guide Me", "Category": "inspiration"}
