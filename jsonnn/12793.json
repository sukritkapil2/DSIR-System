{"Quote": "I would argue that unless the two people are in love, all sex is bad sex, because why eat cotton candy when you can have edible clouds? Sure, it seems sweet at the time, but thatâ€™s just a carnival and carnal rush and wears off quickly. But love adds an extra dimension that takes an earthy thing like sex and makes it absolutely heavenly.", "Author": "Jarod Kintz,  This Book is Not FOR SALE", "Category": "wisdom"}
