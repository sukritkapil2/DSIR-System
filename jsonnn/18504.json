{"Quote": "... is it truly possible to steal a life, if... the Self is eternal and cannot die? Should this be so, then one who 'murders' does no more than transgress against the will of another, whose choice it is to live. At bottom, a murderer offends not against the body, but against the spirit.", "Author": "Ki Longfellow,  Flow Down Like Silver: Hypatia of Alexandria", "Category": "death"}
