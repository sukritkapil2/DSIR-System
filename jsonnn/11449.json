{"Quote": "Darkling I listen; and, for many a time I have been half in love with easeful Death, Call'd him soft names in many a mus√®d rhyme, To take into the air my quiet breath; Now more than ever seems it rich to die,To cease upon the midnight with no pain, While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad In such an ecstasy!", "Author": "John Keats", "Category": "death"}
