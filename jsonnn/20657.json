{"Quote": "Creation is bringing potential into being, bringing inspiration into action. Inspiration and action are nothing when they are apart. Inspiration feels like a great a wondrous thing, but if it is not manifested, it is as if it never existed. Likewise, action without inspiration has no purpose. It is only when they are together as one that they are truly something.", "Author": "Kristi Bowman,  Journey to One: A Woman's Story of Emotional Healing and Spiritual Awakening", "Category": "purpose"}
