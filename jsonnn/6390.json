{"Quote": "One of the most spiritual things you can do is embrace your humanity. Connect with those around you today. Say, \"I love you\", \"I'm sorry\", \"I appreciate you\", \"I'm proud of you\"...whatever you're feeling. Send random texts, write a cute note, embrace your truth and share it...cause a smile today for someone else...and give plenty of hugs.", "Author": "Steve Maraboli", "Category": "life"}
