{"Quote": "When every hope is gone, 'when helpers fail and comforts flee,' I find that help arrives somehow, from I know not where. Supplication, worship, prayer are no superstition; they are acts more real than the acts of eating, drinking, sitting or walking. It is no exaggeration to say that they alone are real, all else is unreal.", "Author": "Mahatma Gandhi,  The Story of My Experiments With Truth", "Category": "god"}
