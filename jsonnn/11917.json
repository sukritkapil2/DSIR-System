{"Quote": "Peace is present right here and now, in ourselves and in everything we do and see. Every breath we take, every step we take, can be filled with peace, joy, and serenity. The question is whether or not we are in touch with it. We need only to be awake, alive in the present moment.", "Author": "Hanh Nhat Thich,  Peace Is Every Step: The Path of Mindfulness in Everyday Life", "Category": "inspiration"}
