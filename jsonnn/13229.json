{"Quote": "Words are magic. They have the power to hurt and to heal, and even withholding them has the power to hurt and to heal. What else has as much potency in its absence and can do without doing? What I mean is, even when you don’t say anything, you are communicating as effectively as if you’d spoken.", "Author": "Jarod Kintz,  This Book is Not FOR SALE", "Category": "writing"}
