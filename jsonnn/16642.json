{"Quote": "He does have surprising, secret purposes. I open a Bible, and His plans, startling, lie there barefaced. It’s hard to believe it, when I read it, and I have to come back to it many times, feel long across those words, make sure they are real. His love letter forever silences any doubts: “His secret purpose framed from the very beginning [is] to bring us to our full glory” (1 Corinthians 2:7 NEB).", "Author": "Ann Voskamp,  One Thousand Gifts: A Dare to Live Fully Right Where You Are", "Category": "purpose"}
