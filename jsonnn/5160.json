{"Quote": "After all, what is happiness? Love, they tell me. But love doesn't bring and never has brought happiness. On the contrary, it's a constant state of anxiety, a battlefield; it's sleepless nights, asking ourselves all the time if we're doing the right thing. Real love is composed of ecstasy and agony.", "Author": "Paulo Coelho,  The Witch Of Portobello", "Category": "happiness"}
