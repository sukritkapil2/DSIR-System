{"Quote": "Wisdom cannot be imparted. Wisdom that a wise man attempts to impart always sounds like foolishness to someone else ... Knowledge can be communicated, but not wisdom. One can find it, live it, do wonders through it, but one cannot communicate and teach it.", "Author": "Hermann Hesse,  Siddhartha", "Category": "wisdom"}
