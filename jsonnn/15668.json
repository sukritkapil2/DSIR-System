{"Quote": "As the rain falls and the sun shines, they grow, grow, grow; minds so open, they go through life aware and accepting, seeing light where there's dark, seeing possibility in dead ends, tasting victory as others spit out failure, questioning where others accept. Just a little less jaded, a little less cynical.", "Author": "Cecelia Ahern,  The Book of Tomorrow", "Category": "life"}
