{"Quote": "One time I saw a tiny Joshua tree sapling growing not too far from the old tree. I wanted to dig it up and replant it near our house. I told Mom that I would protect it from the wind and water it every day so that it could grow nice and tall and straight. Mom frowned at me. \"You'd be destroying what makes it special,\"she said. \"It's the Joshua tree's struggle that gives it its beauty.", "Author": "Jeannette Walls,  The Glass Castle", "Category": "life"}
