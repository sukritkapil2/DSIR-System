{"Quote": "I had a dream about you. You were being hung. I had a sword in one hand and a stool in the other. I couldnâ€™t decide which one to use, so I stood on the stool and threw myself on the sword. It was the least I could do to protest capital punishment.", "Author": "Bauvard,  I Had a Dream About You", "Category": "relationship"}
