{"Quote": "It scares me how hard it is to remember life before you. I can't even make the comparisons anymore, because my memories of that time have all the depth of a photograph. It seems foolish to play games of better and worse. It's simply a matter of is and is no longer.", "Author": "David Levithan,  The Lover's Dictionary", "Category": "life"}
