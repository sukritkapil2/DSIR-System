{"Quote": "Love is where you find it. I think it is foolish to go around looking for it, and I think it can be poisonous. I wish that people who are conventionally supposed to love each other would say to each other, when they fight, 'Please â€” a little less love, and a little more common decency'.", "Author": "Kurt Vonnegut,  Slapstick or Lonesome No More!", "Category": "love"}
