{"Quote": "All paths are the same: they lead nowhere. ... Does this path have a heart? If it does, the path is good; if it doesn't, it is of no use. Both paths lead nowhere; but one has a heart, the other doesn't. One makes for a joyful journey; as long as you follow it, you are one with it. The other will make you curse your life. One makes you strong; the other weakens you.", "Author": "Carlos Castaneda,  The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge", "Category": "inspiration"}
