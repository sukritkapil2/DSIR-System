{"Quote": "The soil needs the seed and the seed needs the soil. The one only has meaning with the other. It is the same thing with human beings. When male knowledge joins with female transformation, then the great magical union is created, and its name is wisdom. Wisdom means both to know and to transform.", "Author": "Paulo Coelho,  Brida", "Category": "knowledge"}
