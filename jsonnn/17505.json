{"Quote": "The Coming of LightEven this late it happens:the coming of love, the coming of light. You wake and the candles are lit as if by themselves, stars gather, dreams pour into your pillows, sending up warm bouquets of air.Even this late the bones of the body shine and tomorrowâ€™s dust flares into breath.", "Author": "Mark Strand,  The Late Hour", "Category": "poetry"}
