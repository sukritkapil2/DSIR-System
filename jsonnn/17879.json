{"Quote": "Ah! how little knowledge does a man acquire in his life. He gathers it up like water, but like water it runs between his fingers, and yet, if his hands be but wet as though with dew, behold a generation of fools call out, 'See, he is a wise man!' Is it not so?", "Author": "H. Rider Haggard,  She", "Category": "wisdom"}
