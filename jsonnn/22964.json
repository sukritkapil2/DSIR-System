{"Quote": "The best Morning Prayer for endless peace would be, â€œToday I will forgive everyone for their mistakes. Today I will love everyone without judging them. Today I will be kind to everyone even if they do not deserve it. Today I will be a fountain of peace to create waves of joy around me.", "Author": "Debasish Mridha", "Category": "quotes"}
