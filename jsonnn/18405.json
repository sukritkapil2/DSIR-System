{"Quote": "Suffering sucks. Don't do it. Go home and love your wife. Go home and love yourself. Go homeand base your happiness on one thing and one thing only: freedom. Choose freedom, not suffering. Create a life of freedom, not wanting. Have some really good coffee and listen to the red-winged blackbirds in the marsh. Ignore the mosquitoes.", "Author": "Laura Munson,  This Is Not The Story You Think It Is...: A Season of Unlikely Happiness", "Category": "happiness"}
