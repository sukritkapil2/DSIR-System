{"Quote": "Pragmatism asks its usual question. \"Grant an idea or belief to be true,\"it says, \"what concrete difference will its being true make in anyone's actual life? How will the truth be realized? What experiences will be different from those which would obtain if the belief were false? What, in short, is the truth's cash-value in experiential terms?", "Author": "William James", "Category": "philosophy"}
