{"Quote": "I have sent books and music there, and all / Those instruments with which high spirits call / The future from its cradle, and the past / Out of its grave, and make the present last / In thoughts and joys which sleep, but cannot die, / Folded within their own eternity.", "Author": "Percy Bysshe Shelley,  Poetry and Prose", "Category": "knowledge"}
