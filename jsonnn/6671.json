{"Quote": "It's now very common to hear people say, 'I'm rather offended by that.' As if that gives them certain rights. It's actually nothing more... than a whine. 'I find that offensive.' It has no meaning; it has no purpose; it has no reason to be respected as a phrase. 'I am offended by that.' Well, so fucking what.\"[I saw hate in a graveyard -- Stephen Fry, The Guardian, 5 June 2005]", "Author": "Stephen Fry", "Category": "humor"}
