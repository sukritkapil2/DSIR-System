{"Quote": "I disregard the proportions, the measures, the tempo of the ordinary world. I refuse to live in the ordinary world as ordinary women. To enter ordinary relationships. I want ecstasy. I am a neurotic — in the sense that I live in my world. I will not adjust myself to the world. I am adjusted to myself.", "Author": "Anaïs Nin,  The Diary of Anaïs Nin, Vol. 1: 1931-1934", "Category": "inspiration"}
