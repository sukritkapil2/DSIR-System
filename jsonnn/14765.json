{"Quote": "The finest thing under the sun and moon is the human soul. I marvel at the small miracles of kindness that pass between humans, I marvel at the growth of conscience, at the persistence of reason in the face of all superstition or despair. I marvel at human endurance.", "Author": "Anne Rice,  Pandora", "Category": "soul"}
