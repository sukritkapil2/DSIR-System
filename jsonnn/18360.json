{"Quote": "Why can't we simply borrow what is useful to us from Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, especially Zen, as we borrow from Christianity, science, American Indian traditions and world literature in general, including philosophy, and let the rest go hang? Borrow what we need but rely principally upon our own senses, common sense and daily living experience.", "Author": "Edward Abbey,  Postcards from Ed: Dispatches and Salvos from an American Iconoclast", "Category": "religion"}
