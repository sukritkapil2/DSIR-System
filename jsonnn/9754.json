{"Quote": "Love is the kind of thing that's already happening by the time you notice it, that's how it works, and no matter how old you get, that doesn't change. Except that you can break it up into two entirely distinct types -- love where there's an end in sight and love where there isn't.", "Author": "Banana Yoshimoto,  Goodbye Tsugumi", "Category": "love"}
