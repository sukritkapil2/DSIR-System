{"Quote": "You view the gods as entities without,\"Montolio tried to explain. \"You see them as physical beings trying to control our actions for their own ends, and thus you, in your stubborn independance, reject them. The gods are within, I say, whether one has named his own or not. You have followed Mielikki all your life, Drizzt. You merely never had a name to put on your heart.", "Author": "R.A.
