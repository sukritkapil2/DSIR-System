{"Quote": "I’ve had many enemies over the years. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s never engage in a fight you’re sure to lose. On the other hand, never let anyone who has insulted you get away with it. Bide your time and strike back when you’re in a position of strength—even if you no longer need to strike back.", "Author": "Stieg Larsson,  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo", "Category": "inspiration"}
