{"Quote": "Communicating with God is the most extraordinary experience imaginable, yet at the same time it's the most natural one of all, because God is present in us at all times. Omniscient, omnipotent, personal-and loving us without conditions. We are connected as One through our divine link with God.", "Author": "Eben Alexander,  Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife", "Category": "god"}
