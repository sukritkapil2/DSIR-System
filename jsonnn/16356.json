{"Quote": "It is interesting that Hindus, when they speak of the creation of the universe do not call it the work of God, they call it the play of God, the Vishnu lila, lila meaning play. And they look upon the whole manifestation of all the universes as a play, as a sport, as a kind of dance â€” lila perhaps being somewhat related to our word lilt", "Author": "Alan W.
