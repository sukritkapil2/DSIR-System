{"Quote": "In a very real sense not one of us is qualified, but it seems that God continually chooses the most unqualified to do his work, to bear his glory. If we are qualified, we tend to think that we have done the job ourselves. If we are forced to accept our evident lack of qualification, then there's no danger that we will confuse God's work with our own, or God's glory with our own.", "Author": "Madeleine L'Engle,  Walking on Water: Reflections on Faith and Art", "Category": "god"}
