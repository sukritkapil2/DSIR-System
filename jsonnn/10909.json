{"Quote": "Once, when a religionist denounced me in unmeasured terms, I sent him a card saying, \"I am sure you believe that I will go to hell when I die, and that once there I will suffer all the pains and tortures the sadistic ingenuity of your deity can devise and that this torture will continue forever. Isn't that enough for you? Do you have to call me bad names in addition?", "Author": "Isaac Asimov,  I. Asimov", "Category": "religion"}
