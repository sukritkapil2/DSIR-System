{"Quote": "The writer can grow as a person or he can shrink. ... His curiosity, his reaction to life must not diminish. The fatal thing is to shrink, to be interested in less, sympathetic to less, desiccating to the point where life itself loses its flavor, and oneâ€™s passion for human understanding changes to weariness and distaste.", "Author": "Norman Mailer", "Category": "writing"}
