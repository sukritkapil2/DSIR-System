{"Quote": "Age has no reality except in the physical world. The essence of a human being is resistant to the passage of time. Our inner lives are eternal, which is to say that our spirits remain as youthful and vigorous as when we were in full bloom. Think of love as a state of grace, not the means to anything, but the alpha and omega. An end in itself.", "Author": "Gabriel Garcí­a Márquez,  Love in the Time of Cholera", "Category": "love"}
