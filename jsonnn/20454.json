{"Quote": "When you are soul-centered, you can focus your attention where and when you want to, easily, without distraction. You know to look for what you want to see and experience. You know that what you seek you shall find, and what you focus on in life will be more prominent in your awareness. You know your awareness is powerful and creative.\"~ Sarah McLean", "Author": "Sarah McLean,  Soul-Centered: Transform Your Life in 8 Weeks with Meditation", "Category": "soul"}
