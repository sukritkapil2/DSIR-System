{"Quote": "In life man commits himself and draws his own portrait, outside of which there is nothing. No doubt this thought may seem harsh to someone who has not made a success of his life. But on the other hand, it helps people to understand that reality alone counts, and that dreams, expectations and hopes only serve to define a man as a broken dream, aborted hopes, and futile expectations.", "Author": "Jean-Paul Sartre,  Existentialism Is a Humanism", "Category": "philosophy"}
