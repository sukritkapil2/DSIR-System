{"Quote": "Yes, I understand why things had to happen this way. I understand his reason for causing me pain. But mere understanding does not chase away the hurt. It does not call upon the sun when dark clouds have loomed over me. Let the rain come then if it must come! And let it wash away the dust that hurt my eyes!", "Author": "Jocelyn Soriano,  Mend My Broken Heart", "Category": "romance"}
