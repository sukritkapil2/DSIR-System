{"Quote": "LAW 4 Always Say Less Than Necessary When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control.

The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish.", "Author": "Robert Greene,  The 48 Laws of Power", "Category": "inspiration"}
