{"Quote": "[W]hen someone finds himself quite unjustly attacked and hated on all sides, there is no need for such a person to feel dismayed by misfortune. See how Fortune, who has harmed many a one, is so inconstant, for God, Who opposes all wrong deeds, raises up those in whom hope dwells.", "Author": "Christine de Pizan,  Diti√© de Jehanne d'Arc", "Category": "hope"}
