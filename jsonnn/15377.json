{"Quote": "I want my own will, and I wantsimply to be with my will,as it goes toward action.And in the silent, sometimes hardly moving times,when something is coming near,I want to be with those who knowsecret things or else alone...I want to unfold.I donâ€™t want to be folded anywhere,because where I am folded,there I am a lie.", "Author": "Rainer Maria Rilke,  Rilke's Book of Hours: Love Poems to God", "Category": "poetry"}
