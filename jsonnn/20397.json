{"Quote": "Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it. When we enquire into any subject, the first thing we have to do is to know what books have treated of it. This leads us to look at catalogues, and at the backs of books in libraries.", "Author": "Samuel Johnson,  The Life of Samuel Johnson Including a Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, Vol 2", "Category": "knowledge"}
