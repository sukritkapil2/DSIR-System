{"Quote": "Business people - Your business - is your greatest prejudice: it ties you to your locality, to the company you keep, to the inclinations you feel. Diligent in business - but indolent in spirit, content with your inadequacy, and with the cloak of duty hung over this contentment: that is how you live, that is how you want your children to live!", "Author": "Friedrich Nietzsche,  Daybreak: Thoughts on the Prejudices of Morality", "Category": "philosophy"}
