{"Quote": "And in despair I bowed my head;\"There is no peace on earth,\"I said;\"For hate is strong,And mocks the songOf peace on earth, good-will to men!\"Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:\"God is not dead, nor doth he sleep!The Wrong shall fail,the Right prevail,With peace on earth, good-will to men!", "Author": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow", "Category": "poetry"}
