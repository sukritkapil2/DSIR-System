{"Quote": "I suppose it’s not a social norm, and not a manly thing to do — to feel, discuss feelings. So that’s what I’m giving the finger to.

It thus impedes a broader social acceptance of what someone, or a group of people, might actually be like.", "Author": "Jess C. Scott,  New Order", "Category": "life"}
