{"Quote": "â€ŽThose who aren't following Jesus aren't his followers. It's that simple. Followers follow, and those who don't follow aren't followers. To follow Jesus means to follow Jesus into a society where justice rules, where love shapes everything. To follow Jesus means to take up his dream and work for it.", "Author": "Scot McKnight,  One.Life: Jesus Calls, We Follow", "Category": "faith"}
