{"Quote": "I have learned, that the person I have to ask for forgiveness from the most is: myself. You must love yourself. You have to forgive yourself, everyday, whenever you remember a shortcoming, a flaw, you have to tell yourself \"That's just fine\". You have to forgive yourself so much, until you don't even see those things anymore. Because that's what love is like.", "Author": "C. JoyBell C.", "Category": "inspiration"}
