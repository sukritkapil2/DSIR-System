{"Quote": "I believe in the flesh and the appetites; Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle. Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touchâ€™d from;The scent of these arm-pits, aroma finer than prayer; This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.", "Author": "Walt Whitman,  Leaves of Grass", "Category": "poetry"}
