{"Quote": "Senses of humor define people, as factions, deeper rooted than religious or political opinions. When carrying out everyday tasks, opinions are rather easy to set aside, but those whom a person shares a sense of humor with are his closest friends. They are always there to make the biggest influence.", "Author": "Criss Jami,  Killosophy", "Category": "religion"}
