{"Quote": "Love? I need a lot of love.\"Of course you do. Everyone does. It's funny that we never say it. It's OK to scream, 'I'm starving' in public if you are hungry; it's OK to make a fuss and say, 'I'm so sleepy', if you are tired; but somehow we cannot say, 'I need some more love.' Why can't we say it? It's just as basic a need.", "Author": "Chetan Bhagat,  One Night at the Call Center", "Category": "love"}
