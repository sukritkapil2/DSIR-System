{"Quote": "If we surrenderedto earthâ€™s intelligencewe could rise up rooted, like trees.Instead we entangle ourselvesin knots of our own makingand struggle, lonely and confused.So like children, we begin again...to fall,patiently to trust our heaviness.Even a bird has to do thatbefore he can fly.", "Author": "Rainer Maria Rilke,  Rilke's Book of Hours: Love Poems to God", "Category": "poetry"}
