{"Quote": "People have now a-days, (said he,) got a strange opinion that every thing should be taught by lectures. Now, I cannot see that lectures can do so much good as reading the books from which the lectures are taken. I know nothing that can be best taught by lectures, except where experiments are to be shewn. You may teach chymistry by lectures.â€”You might teach making of shoes by lectures!", "Author": "Samuel Johnson,  The Life of Samuel Johnson Including a Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, Vol 2", "Category": "education"}
