{"Quote": "Love is a decision, it is a judgment, it is a promise. If love were only a feeling, there would be no basis for the promise to love each other forever. A feeling comes and it may go. How can I judge that it will stay forever, when my act does not involve judgment and decision.", "Author": "Erich Fromm,  The Art of Loving", "Category": "love"}
