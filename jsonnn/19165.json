{"Quote": "It is easier for a Russian to become an Atheist, than for any other nationality in the world. And not only does a Russian 'become an Atheist,' but he actually BELIEVES IN Atheism, just as though he had found a new faith, not perceiving that he has pinned his faith to a negation. Such is our anguish of thirst!", "Author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky,  The Idiot", "Category": "faith"}
