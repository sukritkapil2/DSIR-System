{"Quote": "You can’t control what others think. The only thing you can control is yourself. Some people will look down on you for your choices in life, no matter what they are. You can’t do anything about that. The only thing you can do is decide how to live your own life. And to hell with everybody else", "Author": "Marie Sexton", "Category": "inspiration"}
