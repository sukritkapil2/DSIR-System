{"Quote": "Mineral cactai,quicksilver lizards in the adobe walls,the bird that punctures space,thirst, tedium, clouds of dust, impalpable epiphanies of wind.The pines taught me to talk to myself.In that garden I learnedto send myself off.Later there were no gardens.", "Author": "Octavio Paz,  A Draft of Shadows and Other Poems", "Category": "poetry"}
