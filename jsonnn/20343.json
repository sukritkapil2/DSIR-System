{"Quote": "The more death, the more birth. People are entering, others are exiting. The cry of a baby, the mourning of others. When others cry, the other are laughing and making merry. The world is mingled with sadness, joy, happiness, anger, wealth, poverty, etc.", "Author": "Michael Bassey Johnson", "Category": "hope"}
