{"Quote": "If you can’t believe in miracles, then believe in yourself. When you want something bad enough, let that drive push you to make it happen. Sometimes you’ll run into brick walls that are put there to test you. Find a way around them and stay focused on your dream. Where there’s a will, there’s a way.", "Author": "Isabel Lopez,  Isabel's Hand-Me-Down Dreams", "Category": "inspiration"}
