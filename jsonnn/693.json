{"Quote": "I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited.", "Author": "Sylvia Plath,  The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath", "Category": "life"}
