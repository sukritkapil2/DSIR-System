{"Quote": "If others tell us something we make assumptions, and if they don't tell us something we make assumptions to fulfill our need to know and to replace the need to communicate. Even if we hear something and we don't understand we make assumptions about what it means and then believe the assumptions. We make all sorts of assumptions because we don't have the courage to ask questions.", "Author": "Miguel Ruiz,  The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom", "Category": "wisdom"}
