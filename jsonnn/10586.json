{"Quote": "And if these mountains had eyes, they would wake to find two strangers in their fences, standing in admiration as a breathing red pours its tinge upon earth's shore. These mountains, which have seen untold sunrises, long to thunder praise but stand reverent, silent so that man's weak praise should be given God's attention.", "Author": "Donald Miller,  Through Painted Deserts: Light, God, and Beauty on the Open Road", "Category": "inspiration"}
