{"Quote": "Wild dreams torment me as I lie. And though a god lives in my heart, though all my power waken at his word, though he can move my every inmost part - yet nothing in the outer world is stirred. thus by existence tortured and oppressed I crave for death, I long for rest.", "Author": "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe,  Faust, Part One", "Category": "god"}
