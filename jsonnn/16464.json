{"Quote": "Have you ever seen the dawn? Not a dawn groggy with lack of sleep or hectic with mindless obligations and you about to rush off on an early adventure or business, but full of deep silence and absolute clarity of perception? A dawning which you truly observe, degree by degree. It is the most amazing moment of birth. And more than anything it can spur you to action. Have a burning day.", "Author": "Vera Nazarian,  The Perpetual Calendar of Inspiration", "Category": "inspiration"}
