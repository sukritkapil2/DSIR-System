{"Quote": "So the nymphs they spoke,we kissed and laid.By noontimeâ€™s hourour love was made.Like braided chains of crocus stems,we lay entwined, I laid with them.Our breath, one glassy, tideless sea,our bodies draping wearily,we slept, I slept so lucidly,with hopes to stay this memory.", "Author": "Roman Payne,  Rooftop Soliloquy", "Category": "poetry"}
