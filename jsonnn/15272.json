{"Quote": "We rarely find a depth by looking inside of ourselves for it. Depth is found in what we can learn from the people and things around us. Everyone, everything, has a story, Gia. When you learn those stories, you learn experiences that fill you up, that expand your understanding. You add layers to your soul.", "Author": "Kasie West,  The Fill-In Boyfriend", "Category": "soul"}
