{"Quote": "Jealousy is a disease, love is a healthy condition. The immature mind often mistakes one for the other, or assumes that the greater the love, the greater the jealousy - in fact, they are almost incompatible; one emotion hardly leaves room for the other.", "Author": "Robert A. Heinlein,  Stranger in a Strange Land", "Category": "love"}
