{"Quote": "Because the plan God has for each of our lives isn't always the same plan we have for ourselves, Grace. Sometimes, our deaths have more of an impact than our births. It can inspire people to do great things, even greater than they would have had the deaths not happened at all.", "Author": "S.L. Naeole,  Falling From Grace", "Category": "death"}
