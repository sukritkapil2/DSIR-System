{"Quote": "â€ŽGod remains silent so that men and women may speak, protest, and struggle. God remains silent so that people may really become people. When God is silent and men and women cry, God cries in solidarity with them but doesn't intervene. God waits for the shouts of protest.", "Author": "Elsa Tamez", "Category": "faith"}
