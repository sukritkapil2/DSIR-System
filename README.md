## Creating the GUI

Flask Framework V-1.0.2 has been used to create the GUI. It is a web application framework written in Python. It contains boilerplate code consisting of html, css and bootstrap files for easy front-end development.

On the homepage, the user can search for the books using title, author's name or even categories using the search box. Top 10 most relevant books along with their authors will be displayed over the next page.

For better user experience, the books thumbnails are shown as well.
