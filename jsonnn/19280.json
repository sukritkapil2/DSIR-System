{"Quote": "The destiny of your soul is not predicated upon acceptance of a specific dogma that happens to be \"correct.\"A loving God does not dole out eternal condemnation because one has selected the wrong doctrine or misinterpreted scripture. On the contrary, your endeavor to understand God and the nature of the universe is a testament to your devotion.", "Author": "Mark Ireland", "Category": "god"}
