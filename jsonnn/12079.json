{"Quote": "Everyone must leave something behind when he dies . . . Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die . . . It doesn't matter what you do, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that's like you after you take your hands away.", "Author": "Ray Bradbury,  Fahrenheit 451", "Category": "death"}
