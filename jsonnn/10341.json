{"Quote": "I have been used to consider poetry as \"the food of love\"said Darcy.\"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what isstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, Iam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.", "Author": "Jane Austen,  Pride and Prejudice", "Category": "poetry"}
