{"Quote": "A man of God would never burn or harm a temple of any kind - regardless of religion. A true man of God would see every temple or divine mansion built to glorify the Creator - as an extension of the temple closest to his home, regardless of its shape, size, or color. A man who truly recognizes and knows God can see God in all things.", "Author": "Suzy Kassem,  Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem", "Category": "god"}
