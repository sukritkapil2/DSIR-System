{"Quote": "I missed you, Angel. Not one day went by that I didn't feel you missing from my life. You haunted me to the point that I began to believe Hank had gone back on his oath and killed you. I couldn't escape you and I didn't want to. You tortured me, but it was better than losing you.", "Author": "Becca Fitzpatrick,  Silence", "Category": "love"}
