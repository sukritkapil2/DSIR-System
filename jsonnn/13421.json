{"Quote": "Allowing yourself to stop reading a book - at page 25, 50, or even, less frequently, a few chapters from the end - is a rite of passage in a reader's life, the literary equivalent of a bar mitzvah or a communion, the moment at which you look at yourself and announce: Today I am an adult. I can make my own decisions.", "Author": "Sara Nelson,  So Many Books, So Little Time: A Year of Passionate Reading", "Category": "books"}
