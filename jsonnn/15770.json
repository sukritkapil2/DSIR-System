{"Quote": "The wind may be invisible, but itâ€™s colored by memories of you, as you gently blew into my life, adding motion and emotion to my still-beating heart. I feel you here with me, even though I'm all alone. Time is only measured now by then seconds since you've gone, and losing you is as painful as running a faucet on a bloody wound.-Jarod Kintz and Crystal Woods", "Author": "Jarod Kintz,  liQUID PROse QUOtes", "Category": "poetry"}
