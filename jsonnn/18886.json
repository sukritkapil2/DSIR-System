{"Quote": "Unhappiness can be like a virus spreading from one person, to the next person, to the next one and so on. When someone is mean or rude to you, do not let their unhappiness infect your own life. If you are the unhappy one, please quarantine yourself so you do not infect others!", "Author": "Jennifer O'Neill,  Soul DNA: Your Spiritual Genetic Code Defines Your Purpose", "Category": "happiness"}
