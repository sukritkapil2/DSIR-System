{"Quote": "Children are living beings - more living than grown-up people who have built shells of habit around themselves. Therefore it is absolutely necessary for their mental health and development that they should not have mere schools for their lessons, but a world whose guiding spirit is personal love.", "Author": "Rabindranath Tagore", "Category": "education"}
