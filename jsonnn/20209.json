{"Quote": "But love doesn't always generate hope. Anyone who has ever experienced love knows that you can have too much love or too little. You can have love that parches, love that defeats. You can have love measured out in the wrong proportions. It's like your sunlight and water--the wrong kind of love is just as likely to stifle hope as it is to nourish it.", "Author": "Kevin Brockmeier,  The Brief History of the Dead", "Category": "hope"}
