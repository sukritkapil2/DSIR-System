{"Quote": "Because when I read, I don't really read; I pop a beautiful sentence into my mouth and suck it like a fruit drop, or I sip it like a liqueur until the thought dissolves in me like alcohol, infusing brain and heart and coursing on through the veins to the root of each blood vessel.", "Author": "Bohumil Hrabal,  Too Loud a Solitude", "Category": "books"}
