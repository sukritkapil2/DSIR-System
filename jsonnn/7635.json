{"Quote": "Half the night I waste in sighs,Half in dreams I sorrow afterThe delight of early skies;In a wakeful dose I sorrowFor the hand, the lips, the eyes,For the meeting of the morrow,The delight of happy laughter,The delight of low replies.", "Author": "Alfred Lord Tennyson,  Maud, and other poems", "Category": "love"}
