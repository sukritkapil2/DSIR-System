{"Quote": "The times you lived through, the people you shared those times with â€” nothing brings it all to life like an old mix tape. It does a better job of storing up memories than actual brain tissue can do. Every mix tape tells a story. Put them together, and they can add up to the story of a life.", "Author": "Rob Sheffield,  Love Is a Mix Tape", "Category": "life"}
