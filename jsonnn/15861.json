{"Quote": "To be changed by ideas was pure pleasure. But to learn ideas that ran counter to values and beliefs learned at home was to place oneself at risk, to enter the danger zone. Home was the place where I was forced to conform to someone elseâ€™s image of who and what I should be. School was the place where I could forget that self and, through ideas, reinvent myself.", "Author": "bell hooks", "Category": "education"}
