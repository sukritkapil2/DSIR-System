{"Quote": "I drift like a cloud,Across these venerable eastern lands,A journey of unfathomable distances,An endless scroll of experiences...Lady Zhejiang here we must part,For the next province awaits my embrace.Sad wanderer, once you conquer the East,Where do you go?", "Author": "Tom Carter,  China: Portrait of a People", "Category": "quotes"}
