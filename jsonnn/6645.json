{"Quote": "The president of the United States has claimed, on more than one occasion, to be in dialogue with God. If he said that he was talking to God through his hairdryer, this would precipitate a national emergency. I fail to see how the addition of a hairdryer makes the claim more ridiculous or offensive.", "Author": "Sam Harris,  Letter to a Christian Nation", "Category": "god"}
