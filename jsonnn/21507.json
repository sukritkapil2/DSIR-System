{"Quote": "Then every man would be as a god, you see. The result of this, of course, would be that there would no longer be any gods, only men. We would give them knowledge of the sciences and the arts, which we possess, and in so doing we would destroy their simple faith and remove all basis for their hoping that things will be betterâ€”for the best way to destroy faith or hope is to let it be realized.", "Author": "Roger Zelazny,  Lord of Light", "Category": "hope"}
