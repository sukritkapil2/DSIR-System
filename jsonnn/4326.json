{"Quote": "Making love with a woman and sleeping with a woman are two separate passions, not merely different but opposite. Love does not make itself felt in the desire for copulation (a desire that extends to an infinite number of women) but in the desire for shared sleep (a desire limited to one woman).", "Author": "Milan Kundera,  The Unbearable Lightness of Being", "Category": "love"}
