{"Quote": "What makes a hero? Courage, strength, morality, withstanding adversity? Are these the traits that truly show and create a hero? Is the light truly the source of darkness or vice versa? Is the soul a source of hope or despair? Who are these so called heroes and where do they come from? Are their origins in obscurity or in plain sight?", "Author": "Fyodor Dostoyevsky,  Notes from Underground", "Category": "hope"}
