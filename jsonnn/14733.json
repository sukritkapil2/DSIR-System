{"Quote": "I never thought of it like that. I always thought of you as a part of me, like my own eyes or my own hands. You don't go around thinking 'I love my eyes, I love my hands', do you? But think what it would be like to live without your eyes or your hands. To be mad, or to be blind. I can't talk about it. It's how I feel.", "Author": "Elizabeth Marie Pope,  The Perilous Gard", "Category": "inspiration"}
