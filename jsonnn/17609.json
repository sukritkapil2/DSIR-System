{"Quote": "Pirate Captain Jim\"Walk the plank,\"says Pirate Jim\"But Captain Jim, I cannot swim.\"\"Then you must steer us through the gale.\"\"But Captain Jim, I cannot sail.\"\"Then down with the galley slaves you go.\"\"But Captain Jim, I cannot row.\"\"Then you must be the pirate's clerk.\"\"But Captain Jim, I cannot work.", "Author": "Shel Silverstein", "Category": "poetry"}
