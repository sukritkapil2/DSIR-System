{"Quote": "Take this kiss upon the brow!And, in parting from you now,Thus much let me avow-You are not wrong, who deemThat my days have been a dream;Yet if hope has flown awayIn a night, or in a day,In a vision, or in none,Is it therefore the less gone?All that we see or seemIs but a dream within a dream.", "Author": "Edgar Allan Poe,  The Complete Stories and Poems", "Category": "poetry"}
