{"Quote": "We are the music-makers,And we are the dreamers of dreams,Wandering by lone sea-breakers,And sitting by desolate streams.World-losers and world-forsakers,Upon whom the pale moon gleams;Yet we are the movers and shakers,Of the world forever, it seems.", "Author": "Arthur O'Shaughnessy,  Poems of Arthur O'Shaughnessy", "Category": "inspiration"}
