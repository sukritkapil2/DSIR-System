{"Quote": "practice only envisioning yourself at the finish line and be unrelenting and fervent in racing towards that finish line. Undue preoccupation and fixation with the how's, whens, and what ifs will not only derail and further distance you from your destination, but will also feed your mind with those fatal seeds of doubt that make failure inevitable\"~ Awaken and Unleash your Victor", "Author": "Ogor Winnie Okoye", "Category": "faith"}
