{"Quote": "Her last conscious thought was disgust at life; her senses had lied to her. The world was not made of energy and delight but of foulness, betrayal, and lassitude. Living was hateful, and death was no better, and from end to end of the universe this was the first and last and only truth.", "Author": "Philip Pullman,  The Subtle Knife", "Category": "death"}
