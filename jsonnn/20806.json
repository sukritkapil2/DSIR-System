{"Quote": "The computer focuses ruthlessly on things that can be represented in numbers. In so doing, it seduces people into thinking that other aspects of knowledge are either unreal or unimportant. The computer treats reason as an instrument for achieving things, not for contemplating things. It narrows dramatically what we know and intended by reason.", "Author": "George Friedman,  The Next 100 Years: A Forecast for the 21st Century", "Category": "knowledge"}
