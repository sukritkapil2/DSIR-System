{"Quote": "Seen politically, systems follow one another, each consuming the previous one. They live on ever-bequeathed and ever-disappointed hope, which never entirely fades. Its spark is all that survives, as it eats its way along the blasting fuse. For this spark, history is merely an occasion, never a goal.", "Author": "Ernst JÃ¼nger,  Eumeswil", "Category": "hope"}
