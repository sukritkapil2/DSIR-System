{"Quote": "You see, in my view a writer is a writer not because she writes well and easily, because she has amazing talent, because everything she does is golden. In my view a writer is a writer because even when there is no hope, even when nothing you do shows any sign of promise, you keep writing anyway.\"[Becoming a Writer/ The List, O Magazine, November 2009]", "Author": "Junot DÃ­az", "Category": "writing"}
