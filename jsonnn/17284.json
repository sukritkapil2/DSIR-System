{"Quote": "Books, for me, are a home. Books don't make a home - they are one, in the sense that just as you do with a door, you open a book, and you go inside. Inside there is a different kind of time and space. There is warmth there too - a hearth. I sit down with a book and I am warm.", "Author": "Jeanette Winterson,  Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?", "Category": "books"}
