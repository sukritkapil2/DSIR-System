{"Quote": "Students never appreciate their teachers while they are learning. It is only later, when they know more of the world, that they understand how indebted they are to those who instructed them. Good teachers expect no praise or love from the young. They wait for it, and in time, it comes.", "Author": "Darren Shan,  Vampire Mountain", "Category": "education"}
