{"Quote": "This is what love does: It makes you want to rewrite the world. It makes you want to choose the characters, build the scenery, guide the plot. The person you love sits across from you, and you want to do everything in your power to make it possible, endlessly possible. And when itâ€™s just the two of you, alone in a room, you can pretend that this is how it is, this is how it will be.", "Author": "David Levithan,  Every Day", "Category": "love"}
