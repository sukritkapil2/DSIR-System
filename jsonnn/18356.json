{"Quote": "Bad luck with women is a determined man's road to success. For every affliction, he makes, out of indignation, yet another advancement in order to exceed the man that the woman chose over him. This goes to show that great men are made great because they once learned how to fight the feeling of rejection.", "Author": "Criss Jami,  Venus in Arms", "Category": "inspiration"}
