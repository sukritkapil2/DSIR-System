{"Quote": "You gave me hyacinths first a year ago; They called me the hyacinth girl.' â€”Yet when we came back, late, from the Hyacinth garden, Your arms full, and your hair wet, I could not Speak, and my eyes failed, I was neither Living nor dead, and I knew nothing, Looking into the heart of light, the silence. Od' und leer das Meer.", "Author": "T.S. Eliot,  The Waste Land and Other Writings", "Category": "poetry"}
