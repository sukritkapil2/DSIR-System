{"Quote": "Hurl yourself at goals above your head and bear the lacerations that come when you slip and make a fool of yourself. Try always, as long as you have breath in your body, to take the hard wayâ€“and work, work, work to build yourself into a rich, continually evolving entity.", "Author": "Sylvia Plath", "Category": "inspiration"}
