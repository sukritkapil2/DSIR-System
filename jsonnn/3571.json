{"Quote": "Every book, every volume you see here, has a soul. The soul of the person who wrote it and of those who read it and lived and dreamed with it. Every time a book changes hands, every time someone runs his eyes down its pages, its spirit grows and strengthens.", "Author": "Carlos Ruiz Zaf√≥n,  The Shadow of the Wind", "Category": "soul"}
