{"Quote": "If you live in a past dream, you don't enjoy what is happening right now because you will always wish it to be different than it is. There is no time to miss anyone or anything because you are alive. Not enjoying what is happening right now is living in the past and being only half alive. This leads to self pity, suffering and tears.", "Author": "Miguel Ruiz,  The Four Agreements: A Practical Guide to Personal Freedom", "Category": "inspiration"}
