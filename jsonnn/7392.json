{"Quote": "There's always another storm. It's the way the world works. Snowstorms, rainstorms, windstorms, sandstorms, and firestorms. Some are fierce and others are small. You have to deal with each one separately, but you need to keep an eye on whats brewing for tomorrow.", "Author": "Maria V. Snyder,  Fire Study", "Category": "life"}
