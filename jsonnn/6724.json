{"Quote": "I am convinced that most people do not grow up...We marry and dare to have children and call that growing up. I think what we do is mostly grow old. We carry accumulation of years in our bodies, and on our faces, but generally our real selves, the children inside, are innocent and shy as magnolias.", "Author": "Maya Angelou,  Letter to My Daughter", "Category": "life"}
