He had hit his target, and it was the target he had been aiming for all along: Dustfingerâ€™s heart, his stupid heart. It broke in two as he held Farid in his arms, it simply broke in two, although he had taken such good care of it all these years.", "Author": "Cornelia Funke,  Inkspell", "Category": "death"}
