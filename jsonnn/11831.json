{"Quote": "Because misery, and degradation, and death, and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us, you, of your own will did it. I have no broken your heart - you have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine. So much the worse for me that I am strong.", "Author": "Emily BrontÃ«,  Wuthering Heights", "Category": "death"}
