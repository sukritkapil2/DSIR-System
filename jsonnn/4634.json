{"Quote": "People where you live,\"the little prince said, \"grow five thousand roses in one garden... yet they don't find what they're looking for...They don't find it,\"I answered.And yet what they're looking for could be found in a single rose, or a little water...\"Of course,\"I answered.And the little prince added, \"But eyes are blind. You have to look with the heart.", "Author": "Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry,  The Little Prince", "Category": "inspiration"}
