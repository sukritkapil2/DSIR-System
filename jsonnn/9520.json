{"Quote": "My father used to say that life is what you make it. Today is the first day of the rest of your life. You can’t change the past, but the future isn’t set in stone. You can effect a change there. Move forward not with hatred or love. Move forward with purpose. (Simone)", "Author": "Sherrilyn Kenyon,  Dream Chaser", "Category": "inspiration"}
