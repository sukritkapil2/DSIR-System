{"Quote": "Love those who hurt you the most, because they are probably the ones closest to you.They, too, are on a path, and just like you they are learning to walk before they can fly.

Love them no matter what.", "Author": "Nikki Sixx,  This Is Gonna Hurt: Music, Photography, And Life Through The Distorted Lens Of Nikki Sixx", "Category": "life"}
