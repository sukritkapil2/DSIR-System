{"Quote": "The irony is that while God doesn't need us but still wants us, we desperately need God but don't really want Him most of the time. He treasures us and anticipates our departure from this earth to be with Him-and we wonder, indifferently, how much we have to do for Him to get by.", "Author": "Francis Chan,  Crazy Love: Overwhelmed by a Relentless God", "Category": "god"}
