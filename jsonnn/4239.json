{"Quote": "People like to say love is unconditional, but it's not, and even if it was unconditional, it's still never free. There's always an expectation attached. They always want something in return. Like they want you to be happy or whatever and that makes you automatically responsible for their happiness because they won't be happy unless you are ... I just don't want that responsibility.", "Author": "Katja Millay,  The Sea of Tranquility", "Category": "happiness"}
