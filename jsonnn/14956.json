{"Quote": "...You find a way, somehow to get through the most horrible things, things you think would kill you. You find a way and you move through the days, one by one, in shock, in despair, but you move. The days pass, one after the other, and you go along with them - occasionally stunned, and not entirely relieved, to find that you are still alive.", "Author": "Michelle Richmond,  The Year of Fog", "Category": "inspiration"}
