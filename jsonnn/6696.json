{"Quote": "It's no good trying to get rid of your own aloneness. You've got to stick to it all your life. Only at times, at times, the gap will be filled in. At times! But you have to wait for the times. Accept your own aloneness and stick to it, all your life. And then accept the times when the gap is filled in, when they come. But they've got to come. You can't force them.", "Author": "D.H. Lawrence,  Lady Chatterley's Lover", "Category": "philosophy"}
