{"Quote": "I could be in the middle of a spiritual hurricane, my soul torn and tormented, but when I see you smile it's blue skies for miles. You give me a tsunami of emotions, and my heart is trying to find peace through crashing waves, but they always end up in a cyclone that never dies.-Jarod Kintz and Karen Quan", "Author": "Jarod Kintz,  liQUID PROse QUOtes", "Category": "soul"}
