{"Quote": "Make up a story... For our sake and yours forget your name in the street; tell us what the world has been to you in the dark places and in the light. Don't tell us what to believe, what to fear. Show us belief's wide skirt and the stitch that unravels fear's caul.", "Author": "Toni Morrison,  The Nobel Lecture In Literature, 1993", "Category": "writing"}
