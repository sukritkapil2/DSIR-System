{"Quote": "When you're a writer, the question people always ask you is, \"Where do you get your ideas?\"Writers hate this question. It's like asking Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen, \"Where do you get your leeches?\"You don't get ideas. Ideas get you.", "Author": "Connie Willis", "Category": "writing"}
