{"Quote": "There is a collective as well as an individual humor inclining peoples to sadness or cheerfulness, making them see things in bright or somber lights. In fact, only society can pass a collective opinion on the value of human life; for this the individual is incompetent.", "Author": "Emile Durkheim", "Category": "humor"}
