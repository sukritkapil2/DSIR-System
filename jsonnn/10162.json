{"Quote": "I am lost without you. I am soulless, a drifter without a home, a solitary bird in a flight to nowhere. I am all these things, and I am nothing at all. This, my darling, is my life without you. I long for you to show me how to live again.", "Author": "Nicholas Sparks,  Message in a Bottle", "Category": "love"}
