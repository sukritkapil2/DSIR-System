{"Quote": "God intended Earth. God intended the waters. God intended you and me. We were created in the image and the likeness of God; we are holograms, if you will. So the power, the presence, the energy is within you and me. The energy of God, as life, is within each of us.", "Author": "Mary Manin Morrissey", "Category": "life"}
