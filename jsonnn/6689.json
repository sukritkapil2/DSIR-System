{"Quote": "In life you'll meet a lot of jerks. If they hurt you, tell yourself that it's because they're stupid. That will help keep you from reacting to their cruelty. Because there is nothing worse than bitterness and vengeance... Always keep your dignity and be true to yourself.", "Author": "Marjane Satrapi,  Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood", "Category": "humor"}
