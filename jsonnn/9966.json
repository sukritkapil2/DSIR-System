{"Quote": "I had a dream about you. You were an escalator, and I was a flight of stairs. You thought I was a Luddite, and I thought I was as ostrich, because I hadn’t figured out how to put the fly in flight. One day you broke down, and then you saw that you and I weren’t so different after all.", "Author": "Dora J. Arod,  I Had a Dream About You", "Category": "humor"}
