{"Quote": "I wonder sometimes what the memory of God looks like. Is it a palace of infinite rooms, a chest of many jeweled objects, a long, lonely landscape where each tree recalls an eon, each pebble the life of a man? Where do I live, in the memory of God?", "Author": "Catherynne M. Valente,  The Habitation of the Blessed", "Category": "god"}
