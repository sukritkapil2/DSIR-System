{"Quote": "If the Creator stood before a million men with the light of a million lamps, only a few would truly see him because truth is already alive in their hearts. Truth can only be seen by those with truth in them. He who does not have Truth in his heart, will always be blind to it.", "Author": "Suzy Kassem,  Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem", "Category": "faith"}
