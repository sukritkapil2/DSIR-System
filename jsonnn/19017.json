{"Quote": "Love is the sister to Truth, but they differ in two ways. You must go to Truth to find her. She will never come looking for you. However, you are never to go looking for her sister Love. Love will find you in your own divine timing, when you are ready for her. So don't look, she will come. She always does.", "Author": "Suzy Kassem,  Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem", "Category": "truth"}
