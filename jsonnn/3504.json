{"Quote": "So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they're busy doing things they think are important. This is because they're chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you, and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.", "Author": "Mitch Albom,  Tuesdays with Morrie", "Category": "inspiration"}
