{"Quote": "People who lack the clarity, courage, or determination to follow their own dreams will often find ways to discourage yours. When you change for the better, the people around you will be inspired to change also....but only after doing their best to make you stop. Live your truth and don't EVER stop.", "Author": "Steve Maraboli,  Life, the Truth, and Being Free", "Category": "success"}
