{"Quote": "I am fundamentally an optimist. Whether that comes from nature or nurture, I cannot say. Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lays defeat and death.", "Author": "Nelson Mandela,  Long Walk to Freedom: Autobiography of Nelson Mandela", "Category": "hope"}
