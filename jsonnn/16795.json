{"Quote": "To quote the exceptional teacher Marva Collins, \"I will is more important than IQ.\"It is wonderful to have a terrific mind, but it's been my experience that having outstanding intelligence is a very small part of the total package that leads to success and happiness. Discipline, hard work, perserverance, and generosity of spirit are, in the final analysis, far more important.", "Author": "Rafe Esquith,  There Are No Shortcuts", "Category": "education"}
