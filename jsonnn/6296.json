{"Quote": "I am always sad, I think. Perhaps this signifies that I am not sad at all, because sadness is something lower than your normal disposition, and I am always the same thing. Perhaps I am the only person in the world, then, who never becomes sad. Perhaps I am lucky.", "Author": "Jonathan Safran Foer,  Everything Is Illuminated", "Category": "life"}
