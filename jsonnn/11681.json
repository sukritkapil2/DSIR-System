{"Quote": "You will think me cruel, very selfish, but love is always selfish; the more ardent the more selfish. How jealous I am you cannot know. You must come with me, loving me, to death; or else hate me, and still come with me, and hating me through death and after. There is no such word as indifference in my apathetic nature.", "Author": "Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu,  Carmilla", "Category": "death"}
