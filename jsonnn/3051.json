{"Quote": "I fell in love with him. But I don't just stay with him by default as if there's no one else available to me. I stay with him because I choose to, every day that I wake up, every day that we fight or lie to each other or disappoint each other. I choose him over and over again, and he chooses me.", "Author": "Veronica Roth,  Allegiant", "Category": "love"}
