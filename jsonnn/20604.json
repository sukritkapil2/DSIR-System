{"Quote": "I see at last that all the knowledgeI wrung from the darkness—that the darkness flung me—Is worthless as ignorance: nothing comes from nothing,The darkness from the darkness. Pain comes from the darknessAnd we call it wisdom. It is pain.", "Author": "Randall Jarrell,  The Complete Poems", "Category": "knowledge"}
