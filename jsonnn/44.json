{"Quote": "I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.", "Author": "Pablo Neruda,  100 Love Sonnets", "Category": "poetry"}
