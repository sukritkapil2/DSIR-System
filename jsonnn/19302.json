{"Quote": "God doesn't expect us to be a walking encyclopedia of biblical knowledge. He wants us to know Him, to be in a relationship with Him. This means not only hearing but allowing our understanding of God to change the way we live. Like the wise builder who laid the foundation of his house on the rock, we learn to let our knowledge of God change us.", "Author": "Tyler Edwards,  Zombie Church: Breathing Life Back Into the Body of Christ", "Category": "knowledge"}
