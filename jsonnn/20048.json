{"Quote": "Ultimately we have nothing to fear. Jesus loves us, and he invites us to be confident in that love. As we seek to obey Him, we are not called to assess the risk involved and determine whether or not obedience will be beneficial or safe for us. We are simply called to trust and obey.", "Author": "Dan Baumann,  A Beautiful Way: An Invitation to a Jesus-Centered Life", "Category": "faith"}
