{"Quote": "Reputation is what others think of us; character is what God knows of us. When you have spent what feels like eternity trying to repair a few moments of time that destroyed the view others once had of you then you must ask yourself if you have the problem or is it really them? God doesnâ€™t make us try so hard, only enemies do.", "Author": "Shannon L. Alder", "Category": "faith"}
