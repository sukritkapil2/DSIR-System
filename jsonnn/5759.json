{"Quote": "Some things are hard to write about. After something happens to you, you go to write it down, and either you over dramatize it, or underplay it, exaggerate the wrong parts or ignore the important ones. At any rate, you never write it quite the way you want to.", "Author": "Sylvia Plath,  The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath", "Category": "writing"}
