{"Quote": "The glory of God is the living man, but the life of man is the vision of God', says St. Irenaeus, getting to the heart of what happens when man meets God on the mountain in the wilderness. Ultimately, it is the very life of man, man himself as living righteously, that is the true worship of God, but life only becomes real life when it receives its form from looking toward God.", "Author": "Pope Benedict XVI,  The Spirit of the Liturgy", "Category": "god"}
