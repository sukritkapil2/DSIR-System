{"Quote": "Failure is just part of the process, and it's not just okay; it's better than okay. God doesn't want failure to shut us down.

And all of this without keeping a meticulous record of our screw-ups.", "Author": "Bob Goff,  Love Does: Discover a Secretly Incredible Life in an Ordinary World", "Category": "god"}
