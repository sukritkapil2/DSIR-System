{"Quote": "Hope is the greatest madness. What can we expect of a world that we enter with the assurance of seeing our fathers and mothers die? A world where, if two beings love each other and give their lives to each other, both can be sure that one will watch the other perish?", "Author": "Alfred de Vigny,  Stello", "Category": "hope"}
