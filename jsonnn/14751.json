{"Quote": "â€Ž\"If there is no God, then man and the universe are doomed. Like prisoners condemned to death, we await our unavoidable execution. There is no God, and there is no immortality. And what is the consequence of this? It means that life itself is absurd. It means that the life we have is without ultimate significance, value, or purpose.", "Author": "William Lane Craig,  Reasonable Faith", "Category": "religion"}
