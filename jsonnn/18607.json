{"Quote": "As Lucretius says: 'Thus ever from himself doth each man flee.' But what does he gain if he does not escape from himself? He ever follows himself and weighs upon himself as his own most burdensome companion. And so we ought to understand that what we struggle with is the fault, not of the places, but of ourselves", "Author": "Seneca,  The Stoic Philosophy of Seneca: Essays and Letters", "Category": "mind"}
