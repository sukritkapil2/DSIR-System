{"Quote": "Everything with me is either worship and passion or pity and understanding. I hate rarely, though when I hate, I hate murderously.

But I am much more preoccupied with loving.", "Author": "Anaïs Nin,  Henry and June: From \"A Journal of Love\"--The Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin", "Category": "love"}
