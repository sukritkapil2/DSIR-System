{"Quote": "... the mind was designed not to defend what we want, but to discover what is ultimately true, which should shape our wants and satisfy them more deeply with God. The purpose of the mind is not to rationalize subjective preferences, but to recognize objective reality and to help the heart revel in God.", "Author": "John Piper,  The Pleasures of God: Meditations on God's Delight in Being God", "Category": "mind"}
