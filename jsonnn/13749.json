{"Quote": "Those who take lightly promises they make to those they love are people who find little lasting satisfaction in life. This is not an easy time in which to live. That does not mean that it has to be a difficult time to love, but it does mean that you will find unusual stresses upon your lives and your relationship.", "Author": "Brandon Sanderson,  The Well of Ascension", "Category": "relationship"}
