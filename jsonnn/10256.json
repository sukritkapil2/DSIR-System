{"Quote": "Love chooses to believe the best about people. It gives them the benefit of the doubt. It refuses to fill in the unknowns with negative assumptions. And when our worst hopes are proven to be true, love makes every effort to deal with them and move forward. As much as possible, love focuses on the positive.", "Author": "Stephen Kendrick,  The Love Dare", "Category": "love"}
