{"Quote": "The library was a little old shabby place. Francie thought it was beautiful. The feeling she had about it was as good as the feeling she had about church. She pushed open the door and went in. She liked the combined smell of worn leather bindings, library past and freshly inked stamping pads better than she liked the smell of burning incense at high mass.", "Author": "Betty Smith,  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn", "Category": "books"}
