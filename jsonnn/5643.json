{"Quote": "My soul is impatient with itself, as with a bothersome child; its restlessness keeps growing and is forever the same. Everything interests me, but nothing holds me. I attend to everything, dreaming all the while. […]. I'm two, and both keep their distance — Siamese twins that aren't attached.", "Author": "Fernando Pessoa,  The Book of Disquiet", "Category": "soul"}
