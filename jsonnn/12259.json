{"Quote": "He feared me as many men fear women: because their mistresses (or their wives) understand them. They are scarcely adult, some men: they wish women to understand them, and to that end they tell them all their secrets; and then, when they are properly understood, they hate their women for understanding them.", "Author": "Julian Barnes,  Flaubert's Parrot", "Category": "relationship"}
