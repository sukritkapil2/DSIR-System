{"Quote": "Our obedience is God's pleasure when it proves that God is our treasure. This is good news, because it means very simply that the command to obey is the command to be happy in God. The commandments of God are only as hard to obey as the promises of God are hard to believe. The Word of God is only as hard to obey as the beauty of God is hard to cherish.", "Author": "John Piper,  The Pleasures of God: Meditations on God's Delight in Being God", "Category": "faith"}
