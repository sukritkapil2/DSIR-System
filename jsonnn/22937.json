{"Quote": "If we are not living IN our bodies, honoring them as our TEMPLE, we are closing off the divine channels (nadis) of energy that run through us. Additionally, when we are not in good physical shape, we limit our enjoyment of our life experience. Thus, yoga is spiritual and physical.", "Author": "Dashama Konah Gordon,  Journey to Joyful: Transform Your Life with Pranashama Yoga", "Category": "inspiration"}
