{"Quote": "Love is not loveWhich alters when it alteration finds,Or bends with the remover to remove.O no, it is an ever-fixed markThat looks on tempests and is never shaken;It is the star to every wand'ring bark,Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.\"(Sonnet 116)", "Author": "William Shakespeare,  Shakespeare's Sonnets", "Category": "poetry"}
