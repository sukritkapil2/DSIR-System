{"Quote": "Religion doesn't just cloud our minds. It asks us to deliberately deceive ourselves-- to replace reason with its opposite, faith. And when men operate on faith, they can no longer be reasoned with, which makes them more dangerous than any sane man, good or evil.", "Author": "James L. Sutter,  Death's Heretic", "Category": "faith"}
