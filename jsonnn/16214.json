{"Quote": "I have come to see clearly that life is more than self. It is more than doing what I want, striving for what will benefit me, dreaming of all I can be. Life is all about my relationship with God. There is no higher calling, no loftier dream, and no greater goal than to live, breathe, and be poured out for Jesus Christ.\"--Jamie in Brother Andrew's \"The Calling", "Author": "Brother Andrew,  The Narrow Road: Stories of Those Who Walk This Road Together", "Category": "purpose"}
