{"Quote": "So it follows that those who have reason have freedom to will or not to will, although this freedom is not equal in all of them. [...] human souls are more free when they persevere in the contemplation of the mind of God, less free when they descend to the corporeal, and even less free when they are entirely imprisoned in earthly flesh and blood.", "Author": "Boethius,  The Consolation of Philosophy", "Category": "philosophy"}
