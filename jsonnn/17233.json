{"Quote": "In prison, I fell in love with my country. I had loved her before then, but like most young people, my affection was little more than a simple appreciation for the comforts and privileges most Americans enjoyed and took for granted. It wasn't until I had lost America for a time that I realized how much I loved her.", "Author": "John McCain,  Faith of My Fathers: A Family Memoir", "Category": "faith"}
