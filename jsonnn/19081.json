{"Quote": "Every advance in human life, every scrap of knowledge and wisdom and decency we have has been torn by one side from the teeth of the other. Every little increase in human freedom has been fought over ferociously between those who want us to know more and be wiser and stronger, and those who want us to obey and be humble and submit.", "Author": "Philip Pullman,  The Amber Spyglass", "Category": "religion"}
