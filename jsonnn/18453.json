{"Quote": "There is, so I believe, in the essence of everything, something that we cannot call learning. There is, my friend, only a knowledge-that is everywhere, that is Atman, that is in me and you and in every creature, and I am beginning to believe that this knowledge has no worse enemy than the man of knowledge, than learning.", "Author": "Hermann Hesse,  Siddhartha", "Category": "knowledge"}
