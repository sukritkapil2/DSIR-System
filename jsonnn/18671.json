{"Quote": "[Orange] is one of God's favorite colors--- He stuck it right there between red and yellow as the second color in the rainbow. He decorates entire forests with shades of orange every autumn. It shows up in sunrises at the start of the day, sunsets at the end of the day, and in the glow of the moon at the right time of night.", "Author": "Reggie Joiner,  The Think Orange: Imagine the Impact When Church and Family Collide...", "Category": "god"}
