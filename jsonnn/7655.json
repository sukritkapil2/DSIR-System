{"Quote": "I have good idea, for if you meet some person from different religion and he want to make argument about God. My idea is, you listen to everything this man say about God. Never argue about God with him. Best thing to say is, 'I agree with you.' Then you go home, pray what you want. This is my idea for people to have peace about religion.", "Author": "Elizabeth Gilbert,  Eat, Pray, Love", "Category": "god"}
