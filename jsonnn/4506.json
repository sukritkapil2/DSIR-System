{"Quote": "I am awfully greedy; I want everything from life. I want to be a woman and to be a man, to have many friends and to have loneliness, to work much and write good books, to travel and enjoy myself, to be selfish and to be unselfishâ€¦ You see, it is difficult to get all which I want. And then when I do not succeed I get mad with anger.", "Author": "Simone de Beauvoir", "Category": "books"}
