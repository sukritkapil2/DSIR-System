{"Quote": "Poetry is not a turning loose of emotion, but an escape from emotion; it is not the expression of personality but an escape from personality. But, of course, only those who have personality and emotion know what it means to want to escape from these.", "Author": "T.S. Eliot", "Category": "poetry"}
