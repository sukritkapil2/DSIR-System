{"Quote": "People tend to be generous when sharing their nonsense, fear, and ignorance. And while they seem quite eager to feed you their negativity, please remember that sometimes the diet we need to be on is a spiritual and emotional one. Be cautious with what you feed your mind and soul. Fuel yourself with positivity and let that fuel propel you into positive action.", "Author": "Steve Maraboli,  Unapologetically You: Reflections on Life and the Human Experience", "Category": "inspiration"}
