{"Quote": "Every philosophy is a foreground philosophy â€” that is a hermit's judgment: \"There is something arbitrary in his stopping here to look back and look around, in his not digging deeper here but laying his spade aside; there is also something suspicious about it.\"Every philosophy also conceals a philosophy; every opinion is also a hideout, every word also a mask.", "Author": "Friedrich Nietzsche,  Beyond Good and Evil", "Category": "philosophy"}
