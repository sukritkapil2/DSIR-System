{"Quote": "No wonder male religious leaders so often say that humans were born in sinâ€”because we were born to female creatures. Only by obeying the rules of the patriarchy can we be reborn through men. No wonder priests and ministers in skirts sprinkle imitation birth fluid over our heads, give us new names, and promise rebirth into everlasting life.", "Author": "Gloria Steinem,  The Vagina Monologues", "Category": "religion"}
