{"Quote": "A leader should always be open to criticism, not silencing dissent. Any leader who does not tolerate criticism from the public is afraid of their dirty hands to be revealed under heavy light. And such a leader is dangerous, because they only feel secure in the darkness. Only a leader who is free from corruption welcomes scrutiny; for scrutiny allows a good leader to be an even greater leader.", "Author": "Suzy Kassem,  Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem", "Category": "education"}
