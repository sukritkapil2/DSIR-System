{"Quote": "It is always betterto avenge dear ones than to indulge in mourning.For every one of us, living in this worldmeans waiting for our end. Let whoever canwin glory before death. When a warrior is gone,that will be his best and only bulwark.", "Author": "Seamus Heaney,  Beowulf", "Category": "poetry"}
