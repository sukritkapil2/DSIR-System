{"Quote": "What I have done is to show that it is possible for the way the universe began to be determined by the laws of science. In that case, it would not be necessary to appeal to God to decide how the universe began. This doesn't prove that there is no God, only that God is not necessary.", "Author": "Stephen Hawking", "Category": "philosophy"}
