{"Quote": "Inventory:\"Four be the things I am wiser to know:Idleness, sorrow, a friend, and a foe.Four be the things I'd been better without:Love, curiosity, freckles, and doubt.Three be the things I shall never attain:Envy, content, and sufficient champagne.Three be the things I shall have till I die:Laughter and hope and a sock in the eye.", "Author": "Dorothy Parker,  The Complete Poems of Dorothy Parker", "Category": "hope"}
