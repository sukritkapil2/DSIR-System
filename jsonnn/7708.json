{"Quote": "I want to write because I have the urge to excel in one medium of translation and expression of life. I can't be satisfied with the colossal job of merely living. Oh, no, I must order life in sonnets and sestinas and provide a verbal reflector for my 60-watt lighted head.", "Author": "Sylvia Plath,  The Unabridged Journals of Sylvia Plath", "Category": "writing"}
