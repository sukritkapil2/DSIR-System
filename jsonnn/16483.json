{"Quote": "We live in a world where bad stories are told, stories that teach us life doesn't mean anything and that humanity has no great purpose. It's a good calling, then, to speak a better story. How brightly a better story shines. How easily the world looks to it in wonder. How grateful we are to hear these stories, and how happy it makes us to repeat them.", "Author": "Donald Miller,  A Million Miles in a Thousand Years: What I Learned While Editing My Life", "Category": "purpose"}
