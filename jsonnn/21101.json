{"Quote": "Here is a truth that most teachers will not tell you, even if they know it: Good training is a continual friend and a solace; it helps you now, and assures you of help in the future. Good education is a continual pain in the neck, and assures you always of more of the same.", "Author": "Richard Mitchell,  The Gift of Fire", "Category": "education"}
