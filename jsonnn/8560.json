{"Quote": "Happiness comes from within. It is not dependent on external things or on other people. You become vulnerable and can be easily hurt when your feelings of security and happiness depend on the behavior and actions of other people. Never give your power to anyone else.", "Author": "Brian L. Weiss", "Category": "happiness"}
