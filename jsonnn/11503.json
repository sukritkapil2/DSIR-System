{"Quote": "Wait on the Lord\"is a constant refrain in the Psalms, and it is a necessary word, for God often keeps us waiting. He is not in such a hurry as we are, and it is not his way to give more light on the future than we need for action in the present, or to guide us more than one step at a time. When in doubt, do nothing, but continue to wait on God. When action is needed, light will come.", "Author": "J.I. Packer,  Knowing God", "Category": "faith"}
