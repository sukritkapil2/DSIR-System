{"Quote": "Of course, everyone's parents are embarrassing. It goes with the territory. The nature of parents is to embarrass merely by existing, just as it is the nature of children of a certain age to cringe with embarrassment, shame, and mortification should their parents so much as speak to them on the street.", "Author": "Neil Gaiman,  Anansi Boys", "Category": "humor"}
