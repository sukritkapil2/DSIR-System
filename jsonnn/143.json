{"desc": "Erlang and OTP in Action teaches you to apply Erlang's shared-state model for concurrent programming--a completely different way of tackling the problem of parallel programming from the more common multi-threaded approach. This book walks you through the practical considerations and steps of building systems in Erlang and integrating them with real-world C/C++, Java, and .NET applications. Unlike other books on the market, Erlang and OTP in Action offers a comprehensive view of how concurrency relates to SOA and web technologies.", "title": "Erlang and OTP in Action", "thumbnailUrl": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/AKIAJC5RLADLUMVRPFDQ.book-thumb-images/logan.jpg", "authors": ["Martin Logan", "Eric Merritt", "Richard Carlsson"], "categories": ["Programming"]}
