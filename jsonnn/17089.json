{"Quote": "Nothing is ever truly gone... Not for me, nor for any human being. We can only go forward, unless we are guests in some enchantment that is not is ours. We are condemned to an endless present, and we can never go back-the source of all our joy, and all our sorrow.\"-Hem at Zelika's grave", "Author": "Alison Croggon,  The Crow", "Category": "death"}
