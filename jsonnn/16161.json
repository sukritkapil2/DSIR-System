{"Quote": "That's what education should be,\"I said, \"the art of orientation. Educators should devise the simplest and most effective methods of turning minds around. It shouldn't be the art of implanting sight in the organ, but should proceed on the understanding that the organ already has the capacity, but is improperly aligned and isn't facing the right way.", "Author": "Plato,  The Republic", "Category": "education"}
