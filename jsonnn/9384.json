{"Quote": "I had a dream about you. You took a cruise, and I took a canoe. I paddled alongside your ship out into the Atlantic Ocean and down to the Caribbean. I shouted “I love you” the whole way, but you couldn’t hear me, probably because that man you were with was talking the whole time.", "Author": "Jarod Kintz,  We Had A #Dream About You", "Category": "humor"}
