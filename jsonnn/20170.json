{"Quote": "But no: he was empty, he was confronted by a vast anger, a desperate anger, he saw it and could almost have touched it. But it was inert - if it were to live and find expression and suffer, he must lend it his own body. It was other people's anger. \"Swine!\"He clenched his fists, he strode along, but nothing came, the anger remained external to himself.", "Author": "Jean-Paul Sartre,  The Age of Reason", "Category": "philosophy"}
