{"Quote": "But being the mirrors for each other's souls has a cost: by the time they part from each other, the individuals in the mating pair have become indistinguishable. Before their merger, they each yearned for the other; as they part, they part from the self. The very quality that attracted them to each other is also, inevitably, destroyed in their union.", "Author": "Ken Liu,  The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories", "Category": "soul"}
