{"Quote": "I won't tell you that the world matters nothing, or the world's voice, or the voice of society. They matter a good deal. They matter far too much. But there are moments when one has to choose between living one's own life, fully, entirely, completelyâ€”or dragging out some false, shallow, degrading existence that the world in its hypocrisy demands. You have that moment now. Choose!", "Author": "Oscar Wilde", "Category": "life"}
