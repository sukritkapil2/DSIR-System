{"Quote": "...When you die, the energy that kept you alive filters into the people you loved. Did you know that? It's like a fire you've tended all your life, and the sparks are all scattered into the wind.... That's why we survive as long as we do, because the people who loved us keep us going.", "Author": "Kevin Brockmeier,  The View from the Seventh Layer", "Category": "life"}
