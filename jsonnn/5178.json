{"Quote": "...unrequited love does not die; it's only beaten down to a secret place where it hides, curled and wounded. For some unfortunates, it turns bitter and mean, and those who come after pay the price for the hurt done by the one who came before.", "Author": "Elle Newmark,  The Book of Unholy Mischief", "Category": "love"}
