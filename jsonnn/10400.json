{"Quote": "Another glorious Sierra day in which one seems to be dissolved and absorbed and sent pulsing onward we know not where. Life seems neither long nor short, and we take no more heed to save time or make haste than do the trees and stars. This is true freedom, a good practical sort of immortality.", "Author": "John Muir,  My First Summer in the Sierra", "Category": "science"}
