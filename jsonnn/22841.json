{"Quote": "20 years ago, being called as STORY-TELLER was a TAUNT. Being a good story-teller was equated to ACTORS, DRAMAS, and LIARS etc. But now, being a story-teller is a COMPLEMENT. If you are a good story-teller than you are a good LEADER, you are a good MOTIVATOR and you are a good EDUCATOR. Time has changed.", "Author": "Sanjeev Himachali", "Category": "inspiration"}
