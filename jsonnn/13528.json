{"Quote": "When you have dogs, you witness their uncomplaining acceptance of suffering, their bright desire to make the most of life in spite of the limitations of age and disease, their calm awareness of the approaching end when their final hours come. They accept death with a grace that I hope I will one day be brave enough to muster.", "Author": "Dean Koontz,  A Big Little Life: A Memoir of a Joyful Dog", "Category": "death"}
