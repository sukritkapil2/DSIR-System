{"Quote": "People with a grudge against the world are always dangerous. They seem to think life owes them something. I've known many an invalid who has suffered worse and been cut off from life much more . . . and they've managed to lead happy contented lives. It's what's in yourself that makes you happy or unhappy.", "Author": "Agatha Christie,  A Murder Is Announced", "Category": "happiness"}
