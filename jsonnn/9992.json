{"Quote": "There are two things we should always be 1. raw and 2. ready. When you are raw, you are always ready and when you are ready you usually realize that you are raw. Waiting for perfection is not an answer, one cannot say \"I will be ready when I am perfect\"because then you will never be ready, rather one must say \"I am raw and I am ready just like this right now, how and who I am.", "Author": "C.
