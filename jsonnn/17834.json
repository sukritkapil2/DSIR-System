{"Quote": "It ain't that you get religion. Religion gets you and then milks you dry. Won't let you drink a little whiskey. Won't let you make no fat-assed girls grin and giggle. Won't let you do a damn thing except work for what you'll get in the hearafter. I live in the here and now.", "Author": "Dorothy Allison,  Bastard Out of Carolina", "Category": "religion"}
