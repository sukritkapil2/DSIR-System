{"Quote": "I'm infatuated with you, I cannot deny it. Physically speaking, you're a very attractive man. But I don't like you, the vast majority of the time. So far as I can gather, you behave abominably in public and are only marginally better in private. I only find you remotely tolerable when you're kissing me.", "Author": "Tessa Dare,  One Dance with a Duke", "Category": "romance"}
