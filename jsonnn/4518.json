{"Quote": "Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong! - I have as much soul as you, - and full as much heart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you!", "Author": "Charlotte BrontÃ«,  Jane Eyre", "Category": "soul"}
