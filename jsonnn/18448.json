{"Quote": "There Will Be StarsThere will be stars over the place forever;Though the house we loved and the street we loved are lost,Every time the earth circles her orbitOn the night the autumn equinox is crossed,Two stars we knew, poised on the peak of midnightWill reach their zenith; stillness will be deep;There will be stars over the place forever,There will be stars forever, while we sleep.", "Author": "Sara Teasdale,  Dark of the Moon", "Category": "poetry"}
