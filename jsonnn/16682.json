{"Quote": "Falsehood is so easy, truth so difficult....Examine your words well, and you will find that even when you have no motive to be false, it is a very hard thing to say the exact truth, even about your own immediate feelings -- much harder than to say something fine about them which is not the exact truth.", "Author": "George Eliot,  Adam Bede", "Category": "truth"}
