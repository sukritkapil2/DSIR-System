{"Quote": "What hinders me from hearing is that I am taken up with other things. It is not that I will not hear God, but I am not devoted in the right place. I am devoted to things, to service, to convictions, and God may say what He likes but I do not hear Him.", "Author": "Oswald Chambers", "Category": "truth"}
