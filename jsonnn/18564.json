{"Quote": "A common mistake we make is that we look for God in places where we ourselves wish to find him, yet even in the physical reality this is a complete failure. For example, if you lost your car keys, you would not search where you want to search, you would search where you must in order to find them.", "Author": "Criss Jami,  Killosophy", "Category": "faith"}
