{"Quote": "In my kind of falling, there’s no landing. There’s only hitting the ground. Hard. Dead, or wanting to be dead. So the whole time you’re falling, it’s the worst feeling in the world. Because you feel you have no control over it. Because you know how it ends.", "Author": "David Levithan,  Will Grayson, Will Grayson", "Category": "death"}
