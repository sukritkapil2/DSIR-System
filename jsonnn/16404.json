{"Quote": "Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile or silly action for no other reason than because he knows he should not? Have we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our best judgement, to violate that which is Law, merely because we understand it to be such?", "Author": "Edgar Allan Poe,  The Black Cat", "Category": "philosophy"}
