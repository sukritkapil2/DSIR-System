{"Quote": "Sometimes when we say \"God is silent,\"what's really going on is that he hasn't told the story the way we wanted it told. He will be silent when we want him to fill in the blanks of the story we are creating. But with his own stories, the ones we live in, he is seldom silent.", "Author": "Paul E.
