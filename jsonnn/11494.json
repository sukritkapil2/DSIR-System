{"Quote": "What we have forgotten is that thoughts and words are conventions, and that it is fatal to take conventions too seriously. A convention is a social convenience, as, for example, money ... but it is absurd to take money too seriously, to confuse it with real wealth ... In somewhat the same way, thoughts, ideas and words are \"coins\"for real things.", "Author": "Alan W. Watts,  The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety", "Category": "philosophy"}
