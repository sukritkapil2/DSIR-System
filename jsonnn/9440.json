{"Quote": "Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night. In their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in waking, to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret. In snatches, they learn something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil.", "Author": "Edgar Allan Poe,  Complete Tales & Poems", "Category": "wisdom"}
