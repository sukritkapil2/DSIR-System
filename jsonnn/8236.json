{"Quote": "Don't just say you have read books. Show that through them you have learned to think better, to be a more discriminating and reflective person. Books are the training weights of the mind. They are very helpful, but it would be a bad mistake to suppose that one has made progress simply by having internalized their contents.\"Translation by Sharon Lebell", "Author": "Epictetus,  The Art of Living: The Classical Manual on Virtue, Happiness and Effectiveness", "Category": "wisdom"}
