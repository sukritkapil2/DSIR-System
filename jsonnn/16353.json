{"Quote": "Instead of being encouraged to feel completely protected, loved, honored, and respected by the Divine Force, you've been taught that you're being judged. Because you've been taught that, you feel guilt and fear. But guilt and fear do not open you connection to the Divine; they only serve to close your heart. The reality is that God's way is love, and you can see this for yourself.", "Author": "Michael A. Singer,  The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself", "Category": "faith"}
