{"Quote": "When we hold each other, in the darkness, it doesn't make the darkness go away. The bad things are still out there. The nightmares still walking. When we hold each other we feel not safe, but better. \"It's all right\"we whisper, \"I'm here, I love you.\"and we lie: \"I'll never leave you.\"For just a moment or two the darkness doesn't seem so bad.", "Author": "Neil Gaiman,  Neil Gaiman's Midnight Days", "Category": ""}
