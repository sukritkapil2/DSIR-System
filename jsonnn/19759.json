{"Quote": "Some people are not meant to be a part of our lives forever. Some people visit our lives for a brief period, not to stay in it, but to show us something that we have been unable to see it ourselves. In the form of a gift, a lesson or a piece of wisdom, they change the course of our life and help us to fulfill our destiny.", "Author": "Purba Chakraborty,  Shades Of Life", "Category": "quotes"}
