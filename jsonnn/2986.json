{"Quote": "People come, people go – they’ll drift in and out of your life, almost like characters in a favorite book. When you finally close the cover, the characters have told their story and you start up again with another book, complete with new characters and adventures. Then you find yourself focusing on the new ones, not the ones from the past.", "Author": "Nicholas Sparks,  The Rescue", "Category": "life"}
