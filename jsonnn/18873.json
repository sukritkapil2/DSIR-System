{"Quote": "In philosophy class I think we finally decided that 'good' is an infinitely recursive term - it can't be defined except in terms of itself. Good is good because it's better than bad, though why it's better to be good than bad depends on how you define good, and on and on.", "Author": "Orson Scott Card,  Ender in Exile", "Category": "philosophy"}
