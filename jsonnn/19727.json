{"Quote": "Whatever your passion is, keep doing it. Don't waste time chasing after success or comparing yourself to others. Every flower blooms at a different pace. Excel at doing what your passion is and only focus on perfecting it. Eventually people will see what you are great at doing, and if you are truly great, success will come chasing after you.", "Author": "Suzy Kassem,  Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem", "Category": "success"}
