{"Quote": "I believe in God the way I believe in quarks. People whose business it is to know about quantum physics or religion tell me they have good reason to believe that quarks and God exist. And they tell me that if I wanted to devote my life to learning what they've learned, I'd find quarks and God just like they did.", "Author": "Mary Doria Russell,  The Sparrow", "Category": "god"}
