{"Quote": "Imagine in vibrant, wonderful detail your heart’s desire—a reality only you can envision, an adventure only you can direct.Then cradle your creation. Caress it. Mold it. Coddle it until it comes to life.And when your precious treasure grows so grand as to steal your breath away, set it free for all the world to experience. For that is how you live your dreams.", "Author": "Richelle E. Goodrich,  Eena, The Curse of Wanyaka Cave", "Category": "success"}
