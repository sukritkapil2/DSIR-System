{"Quote": "Despair is for people who know, beyond any doubt, what the future is going to bring. Nobody is in that position. So despair is not only a kind of sin, theologically, but also a simple mistake, because nobody actually knows. In that sense there is always hope.", "Author": "Patrick Curry,  Defending Middle-Earth: Tolkien: Myth and Modernity", "Category": "hope"}
